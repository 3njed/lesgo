				   DISCLAIMER
================================================================================

"Please keep in mind that many parts of the code were developed without a clear
idea of exactly where the program was headed, since various ideas are tried and
discarded as part of the research process.  This means that code organization is
not optimal in some spots, and that not all options are fully implemented.  My
advice is ALWAYS read whatever parts of the code you are using to find out what
they really do." - SC

				    OVERVIEW
================================================================================

The code lesgo solves the filtered N-S equations in the high-Re limit on a
cartisian mesh. Originally lesgo was designed to simulate flow in the
atmospheric boundary layer but has been extended and used to simulate flow over
tree canopies, wall mounted cubes, cylinders in free stream turbulence, wind
turbine arrays, and others. At its core is the LES flow solver. Built on top of
the solver are modules that provide additional functionality such as an immersed
boundary method, wind farm modeling, and others. The following is a list of the
major components of lesgo:

  * LES Flow Solver

  * Level Set Immersed Boundary Method

  * Renormalized Numerical Simulation 

  * Wind farm modeling 

  * Concurrent precursor simulation

Each of these components are discussed in detail in the following sections.

================================================================================
				  DEPENDENCIES
================================================================================

The following dependencies are required in order to compile lesgo:

  * Fortran 95 compiler: 

    Most modern compilers will work fine. Ones that have been used successfully
    are G95, GFortran (>= 4.4), Intel, and PGI

  * makedepf90 (http://www.helsinki.fi/~eedelman/makedepf90.html) 

    The Makefile makes use of this to determine file dependencies.

  * fpx3 (http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~jbehren/fpx3)

    This is a fortran preprocessor. The main reason this is used is to isolate
    calls to MPI libraries, so that if someone wants to run the code in non-MPI
    mode, then it will compile cleanly and the compiler/linker will not complain
    about missing MPI libraries. fpx3 macros are also used to hide some other
    definitions from the compiler, e.g., some array dimensions. The Makefile
    runs the preprocessor as a step in compilation.

  * tecryte >= 2.1.1 (http://panoramix.me.jhu.edu/~jgraham/codes/tecryte)

    Currently all of the data output is written in Tecplot format. tecryte is a
    library that we have developed to write data to Tecplot formatted files. All
    of the data is written in block format and has been optimized to work well
    over both local and distributed file systems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				    OPTIONAL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * MPI implementation:

    A MPI implementation will be required for MPI support. The code has been
    developed and used successfully with MPICH2
    (http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/) but others such as
    OpenMPI work as well.

  * lesgo-tools (http://panoramix.me.jhu.edu/~jgraham/codes/lesgo/tools)

    lesgo-tools provides a set of scripts that aid in working with stable
    snapshots of lesgo and post processing data.

================================================================================
				GETTING STARTED
================================================================================

To get started, you'll need to configure two files: "Makefile.in" and
"lesgo.conf". The file "Makefile.in", in addition to compiler settings, has
preprocessor flags for compiling in different functionality (MPI support,
immersed boundary support, etc.). The file "lesgo.conf" is the input file for
the code which you'll set your case up. It is commented fairly well and is
hopefully self-descriptive enough to get started.

Once you configure "Makefile.in" for your system compile lesgo using:

  make

or

  make -jN

for building using N threads.

The resulting executable name will reflect the functionality that you have
configured into the executable. For instance, for serial lesgo with no addtional
bells and whistles the executable will be called 'lesgo'; if you turned on MPI
support it will be called 'lesgo-mpi'. Once you have an executable there is no
need to recompile for running different cases--this is done using "lesgo.conf".

To configure your case simply update "lesgo.conf" appropriately. As mentioned
above, "lesgo.conf" should be commented well enough to get started. If anything
is unclear, feel free to contact one of the authors listed at the top of the
file.

When running, lesgo will output data to the directory "output". Also during
execution, lesgo writes information to screen based on the value "wbase" in
"lesgo.conf". This information includes time step information, CPU time,
velocity divergence, etc. and is helpful for monitoring the case. Another
important file for monitoring the simulation is the file "output/check_ke.dat"
which has the average kinetic energy of the field. Typically the kinetic energy
will decay during the spinup period and asymptote once stationarity is
reached. This gives a good indicator for determining when to start taking
statistics.

================================================================================
				LES FLOW SOLVER
================================================================================

The LES flow solver is a psuedo-spectral solver in which spectral discretization
is applied in the longitudinal and spanwise directions (x and y, repsectively)
and in the vertical (z) direction 2nd order finite differences are applied. The
solver solves the filtered N-S equations in the high-Re limit in which molecular
viscosity effects are generally neglected. An eddy viscosity closure model is
applied for the subgrid scale stresses. Boundary conditions along the x-y
perimeter are periodic where a log-law stress is applied at the bottom surface;
a stress free condition is applied at the top (channel center) boundary. Solid
objects are represented using a level set immersed boundary method. In addition
to the bottom wall, solid surfaces represented by the immersed boundary method
also apply a log-law stress boundary condition. For temporal integration the
explict 2nd order Adams-Bashforth method is used. Time stepping occurs using
either a static time step or dynamic CFL based dynamic time step. Continuity is
preserved by solving the pressure poisson equation using a direct TDMA solver.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    MPI DOMAIN DECOMPOSITION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The LES flow solver is parallelized with MPI. The flow domain is evenly divided
in the vertical (z) direction between the MPI processes. Each MPI-process has
its "own" z-levels indexed by k = 1 to nz-1. The z-levels k = 0 and k = nz are
overlap nodes and are only for holding data that has been copied from the
process below or above the current one. For the main flow solver, the only
overlap data that is required is for the vertical derivatives. Since the
spectral discretization occurs along the slab planes no additional overlap data
is required. In the future, it may be advantageous to also decompose the slabs
along the y-direction and utilize the parallel FFTW3 MPI library in order to
increase scalability for large domains. 

For the pressure solver a pipelining technique was chosen to parallelize the
TDMA, since it is simple and there isn't really any better options for
parallelizing the solution of many small tridiagonal systems. The best size of
the chunks to send "down the pipeline" can be controlled via the variable
"chunksize", and WILL depend on the computer hardware and simulation size. It
would probably advantageous to add a routine that adjusts the chunk size
automatically by making speed measurements at the beginning of the simulation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			       VARIABLE LOCATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code employs a staggered grid along the vertical direction. This means that
not all variables are stored on the same grid. We call the two grids the 'uv'
grid and the 'w' grid, where the grids are distinguished based on the location
of the velocity components. The only difference is that the 'uv' grid is shift
+dz/2 in the vertical direction, where dz is the vertical grid spacing. Also,
the 'w' grid conforms to the physical domain such that the first grid point lies
at z=0 and the last grid point at z=L_z where L_z is the domain height.

The following is a list of the variables and the grid they exist on. The names
are the same as found in lesgo.

        Variables			'uv' grid	'w' grid
 =======================                =========       =========
 u, v, p				    X
 w							    X
 dudx, dudy, dvdx, dvdy			    X
 dudz, dvdz                                                 X
 dwdx, dwdy 						    X
 dwdz  					    X
 dpdx, dpdy				    X
 dpdz  					                    X
 txx, txy, tyy, tzz			    X
 txz, tyz						    X
 RHSx, RHSy				    X
 RHSz							    X
 divtx, divty                               X
 divtz							    X

Important to note that when all 'uv' grid variables are written to output files
for plotting they are interpolated to the 'w' grid. This step is also performed
when time averaging variables.

================================================================================
				  DATA OUTPUT
================================================================================

The output data from lesgo contains two types: 1) restart data and 2)
visualization data. Both types are described here. It should be noted that the
file names for serial runs will only be listed. In the case of MPI runs some
files will be appended with '.c<id>' where <id> is the z-ordered MPI rank used
in the simulation. For files where this is applicable, it will be noted by the
term 'MPI appendix'

Below are listed the output files along with a description
of their contents. These file use the 'MPI appendix'

  1) vel.out : Contains the core part of the restart data for lesgo. In this
               file the velocity, right hand side of the momentum equation, and
               several SGS variables are store. Essentially all the data
               required from the previous time step or steps is located in these
               files.

  2) tavg.out : Contains the time averaged data from the previous simulation. In
                this file the running averages of the velocity, Reynolds stress,
                etc. are store here and are used to maintain the averaging
                between simulations.
		
  3) spectra.out : Contains the time averaged spectra data from
                   the previous simulation.

The visualization data is located in the directory "output". The "output"
directory is created by making a 'mkdir' system call and should work fine on all
Unix based systems. By default these file are written in Tecplot formatted files
using the 'tecryte' library. The output to this directory depends on the
settings in the OUTPUT block in the input file "lesgo.conf". In this section we
will discuss the output from the core LES solver of lesgo. All data output from
various modules will be discussed in their respective sections.

    * force_avg.dat : Mean field of modeled forces (IBM, turbines, RNS, etc.)
    * tau_avg.dat : Mean of the subgrid-scale stress tensor
    * rs.dat : Reynolds stresses

  2) Averaged over z-planes

                                  <xloc> for the time step <timestep>

E) Data along y-planes (these files use the 'MPI appendix')

				DEVELOPER NOTES
................................................................................

A) File ID reservations:

   All data files that use a fixed file identifier should be opened using
   "open_file" from the "tecryte" library. The library provides a mechanism for
   handling the file identifiers of files that will remain open during the
   simulation. It simply provides the file identifier on a first come first
   serve bases starting with 1001. So if any file identifiers are to be used
   that are not provided by the tecryte library they should be <=1000.
 
================================================================================
		       LEVEL SET IMMERSED BOUNDARY METHOD
================================================================================

For representing solid objects in the flow domain, the level set immersed
boundary method is used. All objects are represeted using a level set or signed
distance function (phi) where phi = 0 on the surface, phi < 0 inside objects and
phi > 0 otherwise. For each grid point in the computational domain the minimum
distance to any one of the objects in the domain must be computed and assigned
to the variable phi using a preprocessing program. The code will then use phi to
compute the surface normals which is then used to apply the log-law stress
within a small "band" along a the surface boundary. For all grid points on or
inside of the surface the velocity is forced to zero using a direct forcing
approach.

To use the level set modules in a simulation, a file "phi.out" containing the
signed distance function data must be created first.  This must be generated
with a separate program (see the program in "trees_pre_ls.f90" or
"cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90" for making the level set files). It is recommended making
the signed distance function exact if possible, or at least sampled at a higher
resolution than the computational grid.  There are many adjustable parameters
within the level set module that control how the boundary conditions at the
level set surface are applied. These are listed in the input file lesgo.conf
within the LEVEL_SET block. If you encounter problems (e.g., kinks in velocity
profiles), try adjusting some of these (e.g., length scale parameters that
control how close a given point must be to the surface before an certain action
is taken). Just make sure to read all code associated with some of these
parameters, since some are experimental, and may not be ready for "prime time".

The variables "nphitop", "nphibot", etc., control how many extra z-levels are
copied between MPI processes when determining boundary conditions (at top and
bottom of the process-local domain).  The values to use here are geometry
dependent, and it is pretty hard to determine in advance exactly what they
should be. These values should be as small as possible so the MPI transfers
involve the least amount of data. Right now, my approach has been to pick some
initial values and when the code fails, then increase the values.  the good news
here is that all the code using these is manually bounds-checked, so if an
out-of-bounds reference is made, the code should always die with an error
message saying which parameter is the problem and offer a suggestion as to what
a better value would be. To adjust these parameters add to the LEVEL_SET input
block a line that has the variable that needs to be modified. For example, if
you run into an error regarding nphitop, add to the LEVEL_SET block a line such
as:

  nphitop = 3

These are omitted by default from lesgo.conf since the defaults seem to work in
general.

Another weakness is that the number of extra z-levels is the same for all
processes, when for maximum efficiency, they really should be allowed to differ.
It should be possible to have the code auto-dimension the "nphitop", etc., for
each process.  On the other hand, this means that those processes that finish
their boundary conditions faster that the other processes will have to wait, so
unless they are given something useful to do, it is probably not worth the
effort.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		       CREATING TREES WITH "trees_pre_ls"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program "trees_pre_ls" may be used for generating the "phi" field for the
level set module. This is a legacy program that generates fractal trees with
either round or square branches. It was originally created to also generate
information for RNS simulations. This feature in the trees module however has
been deprecated and is now replaced by the RNS module. So all of the trees
modules are retained solely for generated the "phi" using "trees_pre_ls".

In addtion to trees, it may also be used to easily generate an array of wall
mounted cubes which is commonly used as one of the test cases for lesgo (see
directory "utils/cubes-process-data").

To use this program, you'll first need to compile it. This is done by
configuring "Makefile.in" and "lesgo.conf" as mentioned in the GETTING STARTED
section. There are a couple settings in "trees_pre_ls.f90" that may have to be
adjusted. Now just compile "trees_pre_ls" using:

  make -f Makefile.trees_pre_ls

This should generate the program "trees_pre_ls". 

To do a simulation using the trees, the user has to write a "trees.conf"
file. The file "trees.conf" is the input file for trees_pre_ls ("lesgo.conf" is
also required by trees_pre_ls). An example "trees.conf" is:

--------------begin trees.conf-----------
# This is a trees configuration file
# this is a comment, it begins with a #

n_tree = 1

# see trees_setup_ls.f90 to see what each of these parameters does
tree = {
  n_gen = 2
  n_sub_branch = 4
  l = 0.3125
  d = 0.125
  #x0 = 0.5, 0.5, 0.0078125
  x0 = 0.5, 0.5, 0.0
  taper = 0.
  ratio = 0.48
  rel_dir = -0.4924038763,-0.8528685321,-0.1736481773,
0.0000000000,0.0000000000,1.0000000000,
-0.4924038763,0.8528685320,-0.1736481773,
0.9848077530,0.0000000000,-0.1736481773
  root_height = 0.75, 1.0, 0.75, 0.75
  twist = -90.0, 0.0, -90.0, -90.0
  #trunk_twist = 90.0
  max_res_gen=1
}
--------------end trees.conf--------------

This creates a tree structure with 2 generations of branches (the trunk counts
as generation zero), with each branch having 4 sub-branches.  The length of each
the trunk is 0.3125 and the diameter of the trunk is 0.125.  If the add_cap
option is true, then the actual length of the tree trunk will be l + d/2 =
0.3125 + 0.125/2 = 0.375.  The center of the base of the trunk is at x0 (given
as x,y,z coordinates).  The branches are not tapered.  The ratio of lengths
between a branch and each of its sub-branches is 0.48.  The directions of the
sub-branches, relative to the parent-branch coordinate system are sub-branch 1:
(-0.49, -0.85, -.17) sub-branch 2: (0, 0, 1) sub-branch 3: (-0.49, 0.85, -0.17)
sub-branch 4: (0.98, 0, -0.17) To see how the branch-local coordinate systems
are defined, see trees_setup_ls.f90. Three sub-branches are placed 75 % of the
way along the parent branch (root_height), and one is at the top of the parent
branch.  Each sub-branch has a twist about its own branch axis applied to it.
The trunk can be twisted separately, but this line has been commented out.  The
maximum resolved generation(max_res_gen) used in RNS is generation 1, note that
there n_gen = 2 is one more than the last resolved generation.  The is mean that
generation two are the unresolved RNS branches.  Even if you want to simulate
more that one unresolved branch generation, right now the code expects
max_res_gen + 1 = n_gen.  Note that although the relations between a branch and
its sub-branches are defined in trees.conf, iterated function systems (IFS) ARE
NOT USED to describe the trees.  Instead, a sub-branch is defined only by
reference to its parent branch.

Next, run "trees_pre_ls" and the level set function required by the level set
routines will be calculated. After running "trees_pre_ls", you should be all set
to begin an LES computation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		       CREATING TREES WITH "cyl_skew_pre_ls"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program "cyl_skew_pre_ls" generates fractal trees with skewed cylinder
branches. It stricly generates a single type of fractal tree which is composed
of branch clusters. The branches in on of these clusters start from a collective
base and are arranged in the z-direction. They spread outward relative to one
another with increasing z-direction. Because of the specific type of tree, the
parameter space for generating these trees is much smaller than the program
"tree_pre_ls" and only requires a hand full of settings to setup. In addition to
creating fractal trees it can be easily used for creating wall (such as for flow
in a duct) or side walls in a channel.

To use this program it is first required to set 

  USE_CYL_SKEW_LS = yes

in "Makefile.in". The program can then be built with

  make -f Makefile.cyl_skew_pre_ls

After it compiles, the input file "lesgo.conf" needs to be setup. In this case
the 'DOMAIN' block has to be configured with the domain size and resolution that
will be using in the simulation. To setup the trees, adjust the settings in the
'CYL_SKEW' block. Once these are set the program can be executed. Note, if
running in MPI, "cyl_skew_pre_ls" can be executed with an arbitrary number of
processors and does not have to match the number of processors to be used in the
lesgo simulation.
 
================================================================================
		       RENORMALIZED NUMERICAL SIMULATION
================================================================================

In this section the Renormalized Numerical Simulation (RNS) module is
described. An overview of the method, its implementation, and usage are given in
the sections below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				    OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Renormalized numerical simulation (RNS) is a downscaling strategy for modeling
subgrid-scale geometric features. It provides a method to represent small scale
features of self-similar objects (such as fractal trees) which are too small to
be represented by the immersed boundary technique. What makes this method
attractive is that 1) all unknown modeling parameters are dynamically evaluated
and 2) information regarding the subgrid-scale (SGS) branches is retained. The
dynamic procedure is performed in an analogous manner to the Germano identity in
which the large scale hydrodynamic drag forces are measured from the level set
module and are downscaled in order to infer the hydrodynamic drag forces due to
the small scale branches.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				 IMPLEMENTATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The RNS module was designed to be very general. In essence it works with any
scale-invariant geometry. The RNS module itself operates on a set of RNS
elements constructed at the start of the simulation. These elements are
generated by decomposing the actual geomtry of the object of interest
(e.g. fractal tree) and reconstructing the object in terms of the RNS
elements. Information regarding the specifics of the geometry are embedded into
the RNS elements and is not explicitly used by the RNS module.

Since the RNS module works directly with the RNS elements it is required to do
the translation of the objects from a description of branches, generations,
etc. in to the three RNS elements: r, beta, and b. This recasting for the
description of the geometry is performed by the subroutine "rns_init_ls" in
which the "r_elem_t", "beta_elem_t", and "b_elem_t" data structures are
filled. These structures contain majority of the geometric information to be
modeled that is required by the RNS module. The subroutine "rns_init_ls" is NOT
provided by the RNS module since this recasting does depend on the specifics of
the geometry. Therefore it is required to develop this routine when new geometry
is investigated.

In addition to filling the three RNS element data structures it is required to
generate the filtered indicator function for the SGS geometry. In similar manner
to the level set module which requires the level set function "phi" to express
the resolved geometry, the subgrid scale geometry is represented by the filtered
indicator function "chi". Effectively "chi" represents projection of the SGS
branches onto the computational mesh. 

To summarize the requirements of the RNS module:

  1) The level set module must be included in the build.      

  2) The filtered indicator function "chi" must be generated with a
     preprocessing program. This would typically be done when the "phi" is
     calculated. An example of the generation of both "phi" and "chi" is in
     "cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90".

  3) The three RNS element data structures must be filled. This is done using a
     separate module that provides the "rns_init_ls" subroutine. The current
     pattern for accomplishing this is a follows. For a given module/subroutine
     set that generates the trees, we'll call it "foo", a module "rns_foo_ls"
     must be created to provide the "rns_init_ls" subroutine. Currently the
     module set "cyl_skew" is the only one to provide this. The module
     "rns_cyl_skew_ls" provides the "rns_init_ls" subroutine. It can be used as
     an template or basis for developing other tree generators for future
     studies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				     USAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use the RNS module, it and the level set module must be added to the build
and this is done by setting

  USE_LVLSET = yes
  USE_RNS_LS = yes

in "Makefile.in". In addition it is required to include a module set that
generates the RNS elements and "chi" field for the specific geometry of
interest. As mentioned above, the only one currently availabe is the "cyl_skew"
module set. It is added to the build by setting

  USE_CYL_SKEW_LS = yes

also in "Makefile.in". After building lesgo, you'll need to configure the
modules in the input file "lesgo.conf". The level set module's configuration is
in the "LVLSET" block. In most instances it will not be required to change any
of the default settings. So if unsure, leave the level set settings at the
default ones. There may be special cases that require adjustment of these
settings and this is highlighted in the "LEVEL SET IMMERSED BOUNDARY METHOD"
above. 

The settings for the RNS module are in the "RNS" block. Here you will adjust how
many RNS objects (called trees), their layout, and model settings. With the
model settings there is a choice of the types of temporal filtering, numerical,
and spatial treatments. The most robust configuration is given as

  temporal_weight = 1
  temporal_model = 1
  spatial_model = 1

There are other setting pertaining to the modeling, but the default ones should
work fine. Of course they may be adjusted on a cases by case bases. The
parameter that may be useful for starting a RNS simulation from scratch is
"cd_ramp_nstep". This setting forces the drag coefficient to be linearly ramped
during a spinup period which may be needed for stability.

The final piece is to make sure the module that provides the translation routine
for the RNS elements is configured. In most instances this has already been done
when the "phi" and "chi" fields are generated.

================================================================================

LESGO also has the ability to simulate an array of wind-turbines.  To use this
feature set USE_TURBINES = yes in "Makefile.in".  The turbine-specific settings 
are found in "lesgo.conf".  These will be discussed in detail below.  The 
subroutines associated with the turbine calculations are found in the files 
"turbines_base.f90" and "turbines.f90".  Note: this feature is fully compatible 
with the MPI domain discretization.

                              THE TURBINE MODEL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each turbine is represented as a drag disk with a force that depends on the 
velocity at the disk (averaged in time and space).  This force is distributed 
across several gridpoints that together represent the turbine.  For large arrays 
the coarse grid resolution does not allow for the modelling of individual 
blades. No tangential forces are applied to the flow, though it may prove
beneficial to include these in the future (see Meyers 2010).

The turbine force is given by 
    F = -0.5 rho Ct' <Ud>^2 A        [Calaf, eqn 18]
        rho is the fluid density
        Ct' is the modified thrust coefficient
        <Ud> is the disk- and time-averaged velocity 
        A is the disk frontal area

The velocity at the disk is averaged in time using a one-sided exponential 
filter.  The filtering operation is as follows:
    G(t) = integral_(-infinity)^(t) { g(t') * exp((t'-t)/T) / T } dt'
        G is the time-averaged quantity (aka <Ud>)
        g is the instantaneous quantity (aka Ud)
        T is the time scale of the filter
Taking the derivative with respect to time and using a first-order 
discretization for the time derivative we find
    G(t+dt) = (1-eps) * G(t) + eps * g(t+dt)
        eps = (dt/T) / ( 1 + dt/T )
        dt is the simulation time step
        T is the time scale of the filter
which is used to update the time-averaged quantity as the simulation progresses.

The force is distributed across gridpoints using an indicator function which
is determined during code initialization.  The gridpoints that fall within 
each turbine radius are located.  To avoid Gibbs phenomenon with sharp gradients,
this indicator function (currently 1 inside and 0 outside a turbine) is smoothed
with a Gaussian filter.  To avoid calculating too many convolutions, the spatial
extent of this filtering process is limited to a set number of gridpoints past 
the turbine radius.  Also, to limit the spatial extent of each turbine, a
minimum allowable value of the indicator function is specified.  Each gridpoint 
with a non-zero indicator function applies a force on the flow.

                       TURBINE SETTINGS IN "lesgo.conf"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first group of settings specifies the wind-turbine array geometry and
orientation.  The user can set the number of turbines in each direction as well
as their size.  Currently all turbines are set to be the same size, but this can
easily be changed (only the input needs to be rewritten).  Several common 
orientations (aligned, staggered, etc) are available and more can be added by 
the user.

The second group of settings relates to the turbine model.  The user is able to 
specify the thrust coefficients Ct and Ct' as well as the time scale for the 
exponential filter, T_avg_dim.  

The third group of settings relates to the filtering of the indicator function.
Finally, the user can choose to use the output from a previous simulation 
(namely the file "turbine/turbine_u_d_T.dat") to continue during a new run by 
setting turbine_cumulative_time = .true.

                               TURBINE OUTPUTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All output files relating to the turbines can be found in the "turbine" folder.
The indicator function is written to "nodes_filtered*" and "nodes_unfiltered*"
Tecplot-formatted files.  It can be useful to load these files with data output
to visualize the turbines, but this can be tricky with Tecplot (it requires
interpolation between zones).

The following quantities are also written to file for each turbine:
    current time
    instantaneous disk-averaged velocity
    current time- and disk-averaged velocity
    instantaneous total force for this turbine
    instantaneous power for this turbine
in the files "turbine_#_forcing.dat".

Finally, the values of the time- and disk-averaged velocity for each turbine as
well as the filtering time scale are written to file "turbine_u_d_T.dat".  
These are needed to continue a simulation (turbine_cumulative_time flag).
