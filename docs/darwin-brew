# Installing on Mac OS with Homebrew

LESGO comes with support for Mac OS with libraries and dependencies installed 
with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). To install with full MPI support, install 
the dependencies using Homebrew. If some of these libaries or dependencies
are already installed, some modification of the CMakeLists.txt file will be
necessary.

1. Install homebrew from https://brew.sh/
2. Install gcc, open-mpi, fftw, and cmake in the terminal:
    brew install gcc
    brew install open-mpi
    brew install fftw
    brew install cmake
3. Change the environment flag for lesgo on line 14 of CMakeLists.txt to:
    set(hostname "darwin-brew")
4. Compile in terminal:
    ./build-lesgo
