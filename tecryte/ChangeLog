	* tecryte.h: Updated open_file interface to use new variable names

2012-07-27 19:41  jgraham

	* open_file.f90: Renamed write_* variable names to open_* variable
	  names since this can be used for writing and reading data

	  Fixed several comments

2012-07-27 18:10  cverhul1

	* open_file.f90: Removed action='write' so the file can be written
	  to OR read from

2012-07-25 10:45  cverhul1

	* write_real_data_3d.ftp: Corrected type (x_2d rather than x_3d,
	  etc)

2012-07-25 10:41  cverhul1

	* write_real_data_1d.ftp, write_real_data_2d.ftp,
	  write_real_data_3d.ftp: Added deallocate commands

2012-07-10 16:46  tag r2_2

2012-07-10 16:46  jgraham

	* README: Updated the comments and information; added details
	  regarding the purpose of each subroutine

2012-07-10 13:43  athorma1

	* ftptof90.sh: Updated inplace sed write to use backup file with
	  extension "tmp". Works for both GNU and BSD style sed commands;
	  tested on Mac

2012-07-10 13:10  jgraham

	* ftptof90.sh: Added workaround for BSD style sed inplace replace

2012-07-10 12:39  jgraham

	* Makefile, ftptof90.sh: Updated things to reflect renaming of
	  files

2012-07-10 12:31  jgraham

	* write_tecplot_header_nd.f90: Updated comments in header
	  information. Renamed name to use lower case.

2012-07-10 11:33  cverhul1

	* write_tecplot_header_nd.f90: Fixed comment that misrepresented
	  "zone" as an integer rather than a character string.

2012-05-23 22:50  jgraham

	* tecryte.h, write_tecplot_header_xyline.f90: Renamed
	  write_tecplot_header_xyline within the interface to avoid
	  conflict. This was an issue esp. with the intel compiler.

2012-05-19 11:54  tag r2_1

2012-05-19 11:54  jgraham

	* write_tecplot_header_xyline.f90: Added ability to write based on
	  file identifier. It is required to call 'open_file' before using
	  this.

2012-05-19 11:53  jgraham

	* Makefile, open_file.f90, tecryte.f90, tecryte.h: Added function
	  for opening files and returning the assigned file identifier. By
	  default the file identifiers start at 1001. This can be changed
	  in the tecryte module.

2012-05-19 00:21  tag r2_0

2012-05-19 00:21  jgraham

	* tecryte.h, write_real_data.ftp: Added function for writting data
	  using a file id. This allows for files to remain open and to just
	  append data. Before it was required to open, traverse to end of
	  the records then write. Now it should be faster especially for
	  growing files.

2012-05-19 00:17  jgraham

	* Makefile: Moved specification of install prefix and child
	  directories up in the order.

	  This just make it more convenient to adjust. The compiler
	  settings should follow since they won't be changed much.

2012-05-03 21:03  tag r1_3_2

2012-05-03 20:29  jgraham

	* Makefile: Removed mcmodel flag from compiler flags

2012-05-03 20:29  jgraham

	* README: Updated author information

2011-09-20 17:02  jgraham

2011-09-09 21:51  tag r1_3_1

2011-09-09 21:51  jgraham

	* write_real_data_3d.ftp: Fixed issue with deallocation of x,y,z
	  arrays when not allocated

	* AUTHORS, Makefile, README, tecryte.f90, write_real_data.ftp,
	  write_real_data_1d.ftp, write_real_data_2d.ftp,
	  write_real_data_3d.ftp, write_tecplot_header_nd.f90,
	  write_tecplot_header_xyline.f90: Converted library name from
	  tecio to tecryte. Updated sources files to reflect this

2011-09-06 16:00  jgraham

	* AUTHORS: Added authors file to note contributions to tecio

2011-09-03 14:16  jgraham

	* tecryte.f90: Reverted last commit to revision 1.6

	  Revision 1.7 was erroneously committed

2011-09-03 14:08  jgraham

	* Makefile: Removed unused -fPIC flag (only use with shared
	  libraries); updated library name to reflect development

2011-09-03 14:07  jgraham

	* tecryte.f90: IGNORE THIS COMMIT

2011-09-03 12:46  jgraham

	* README: Updated line wrapping for uniformity

2011-09-03 12:38  jgraham

	* tecryte.f90: Updated double precison data to be written to file
	  as single precision

	  This is to 1) decrease overall write time and 2) save space since
	  the extra bits probably aren't necessary.

2011-09-02 17:36  jgraham

	* write_real_data.ftp, write_real_data_1d.ftp,
	  write_real_data_2d.ftp, write_real_data_3d.ftp: Updated all file
	  writes to use a block line write.

	  This fixes problems with writing many small bits over network or
	  distributed file systems. Also optimizes the performance on local
	  file systems. All data wrapping now is performed in system memory
	  before the write.

2011-09-02 17:34  jgraham

	* ftptof90.sh, tecryte.f90: Updated the data output specifier to
	  respect single or double precision data.

	  Also updated the template to source generator to replace
	  <DATAFORMAT> with an appropriate value

2011-09-02 17:32  jgraham

	* tecryte.f90, tecryte.h, write_tecplot_header_nd.f90,
	  write_tecplot_header_xyline.f90: Changed the naming convention of
	  several functions and variables; this is to make things more
	  readable and eliminate funky abbreviations

2011-09-02 17:31  jgraham

	* Makefile: Updated default compiler flags to use -O3 optimization;
	  change default install location to lib instead of lib64

2011-04-16 03:44  jgraham

	* Makefile, README, tecryte.h, write_tecplot_header_nd.f90: Changed

2011-03-04 15:10  jgraham

	* tecryte.f90, tecryte.h: Added subroutines not in the tecio module
	  to their own file; create external interfaces for overloaded
	  subroutines

2011-03-04 15:09  jgraham

	* ftptof90.sh: Changed to be called once to create all source

2011-03-04 15:07  jgraham

	* write_real_data_1d.ftp, write_real_data_2d.ftp,
	  write_real_data_3d.ftp, write_real_data.ftp: Adding templates for
	  fortran source; these along with ftptof90.sh act to reduce the
	  amount of redundancy due to the overloaded subroutines

2011-03-04 14:34  jgraham

	* ftptof90.sh: Added script to generate *.f90 files from a template
