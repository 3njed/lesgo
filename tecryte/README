The tecryte library provides an interface for creating Tecplot formatted data
files. The library includes two types of interfaces: 1) subroutines for created
Tecplot header information and 2) subroutine for writing real (single or double
precision) data in block format. Therefore, non-Tecplot data files written in
block format may also be obtained with tecryte.

The library provides support for both single and double precision for all
interfaces. Please note that the only real variable that has a static precision
is 'soln_time' (an optional argument) in 'write_tecplot_header_nd' which is
single or real(4).

Provided subroutines:

1) write_real_data              write a vector to a specified file

2) write_real_data_1d           write 1d data in block format

3) write_real_data_2d		write 2d data in block format

4) write_real_data_3d           write 3d data in block format

5) write_tecplot_header_xyline  write Tecplot header for xyline type data;
				typically use for writing header for data
				written with 'write_real_data'

6) write_tecplot_header_nd 	write Tecplot header for n-dimensional data sets;
   				typically used to write the Tecplot header for
   				data written with 'write_real_data_{1,2,3}d'

7) open_file 			interface for opening data files; it provides a mechanism for
   				generating unique file identifiers

Detailed comments regarding the capabilties of the subroutines may be seen in
the source files. 

To compile, check that the Makefile settings are correct for your
system. Then run:

  make source

to build the source files from templates. Compile and install
with:

  make && make install

To use the library include tecryte.h within your program, then link
against the tecryte library after compiling your program.

Example: Suppose tecryte is installed in /usr/local where tecryte.h
resides in /usr/local/include and libftecryte.a resides in
/usr/local/lib. A sample program file may be as follows:

=======================================
program tecryte_test

:
:

implicit none
include 'tecryte.h'

real(4) :: u(10,10,10)
real(8) :: v(10,10,10)

:
:

call write_tecplot_header_ND( ... )
call write_real_data_3D( ..., u, ... )

call write_tecplot_header_ND( ... )
call write_real_data_3D( ..., v, ... )


end program tecryte_test
=======================================

Then to compile:

gfortran -I/usr/local/include -c tecryte_test.f90
gfortran -L/usr/local/lib -o tecryte_test tecryte_test.o -ltecryte
