The program "interp" reads "vel.out" files from one simulation and interpolates
the data to the domain of the desired simulation.

To configure and build:

  1) Set parameters in "interp.f90"

  2) Set compiler parameters in "Makefile.in" in the top lesgo directory.

  3) Build interp by running:

       make

Now execute "interp" in the directory that the "vel.out" files from the old
simulations are located. The old input files are saved under save.vel.out. Note that
you have to throw away the tavg.* files in the home directory. These data are
NOT interpolated.
