                   TO DO LIST
================================================================================

KEY:
(NN) items that have not been implemented
(II) items that are in progress
(CC) items that are complete

ITEMS:

(NN) Move to CMake in order to eliminate the need for out-of-date 
     dependencies fmakedepf90 and fpx3. This requires changing the 
     precompiler flags to be compatible for cpp (C preprocessor) and 
     writing a new CMakeLists.txt file and build process.
     Assigned to CS with testing by JB and TM

(II) Remove deprecated preprocessor flags DEBUG, VERBOSE, DBLPREC
     Assigned to everyone
     TM - removed DEBUG

(NN) Make Binary default output with CGNS enabled through compiler flag
     Assigned to no one

(CC) Remove commented out references to Tecryte
     Assigned to no one
     This has been removed from io.f90

(NN) Remove FFTW2 support
     Assigned to JB

(CC) Fix some IO problems caused by removing Tecryte support
     Assigned to TM
     Added points writing capabilities.
     Velocity as a function of time is done by having a single file
     per point called point{number}.dat

(NN) Interpolation from restart files to allow changes in domain size,
     grid size, and domain decomposition for parallelization. 
     Assigned to JB

(NN) Include matlab functions for reading binary output files. 
     Assigned to JB

(NN) Related to task above (matlab functions for reading binary output files),
      add a 'post_processing' folder which includes basic utilities for reading
      data into MATLAB, paraview, vapor, etc.
      Assigned to no one.

(II) Cleanup unused lesgo.conf input. This is mostly restart file flags.
     Assigned to no one
     TM -  Removed the initialization flags.
     There is still more stuff to be cleaned up

(NN) Include developer style guide. This may be contentious and will need to
     be discussed and included incrementally.
     Assigned to no one.

(NN) Include detailed installation notes.
     Assigned to no one.

(NN) Add folder which includes basic submit scripts for different systems like
      MARCC, panoramix, etc.
      Assigned to no one.
      
(NN) Investigate the near-wall boundary issue in convec.f90 (using first vs 
      second grid point). 
      Assigned to no one.

================================================================================
                   NOTES
================================================================================
1. Developers MUST support both output types (binary and CGNS). This means that 
   any changes or additions you make to one output type MUST be reflected in the
   other output type.

================================================================================
                   BROKEN FEATURES
================================================================================
1. Subgrid models 2, 3, and 4 appear to be broken at the moment
2. The spectra calculations are broken (jb)
3. By removing tecryte support and moving to cmake the level set code will not 
   compile. The legacy makefiles are now stored in mk-old. Work is needed to 
   move the preprocessor building to cmake and restoring support for these
   features. (cs)

================================================================================
                   REMOVED FEATURES
================================================================================

1. 2011-09-13: All of the original "buildings" immersed boundary modeling has
   been deemed deprecated and thus removed. To obtain the latest code before the
   remove refer to CVS tag: pre_immersedbc_buildings_remove

2. 2011-09-15: All of the original scalar calculations have been removed. The
   scalar calculations were removed since they 1) are not currently being used
   and 2) should, if reimplemented, be done in a consistent way with the current
   coding constructs of lesgo. To obtain the latest code before the remove refer
   to CVS tag: pre_scalar_calculations_remove
