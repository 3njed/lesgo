	* Makefile, level_set.f90, main.f90, param.f90, stats_init.f90,
	  trees_base_ls.f90, trees_pre_ls.f90: Merged from devel branch.
	  Includes:

	  1. bug fix in trees_base_ls in pt_of_grid 2. addition of wall
	  time calc in main

2009-06-18 13:27  jgraham

	* main.f90: Added wall time calculation and output

2009-06-18 13:26  jgraham

	* Makefile: Added panoramix optimized FFLAGS

2009-06-18 10:52  jgraham

	* Makefile: Set makefile to include panoramix optimizations based
	  on the suggestions in ifort man page

2009-06-18 08:55  jgraham

	* level_set.f90: Turn debugging off

2009-06-17 21:59  jgraham

	* Makefile, param.f90, stats_init.f90: Made adjustments to cube_mpi
	  case; having issues with code blowing up during execution

2009-06-17 21:53  jgraham

	* level_set.f90: Reverted changes to original

2009-06-17 21:31  jgraham

	* param.f90: Updated grid dimensions for cube_mpi run; generated
	  the phi.out and brindex.out files with trees_pre_ls

2009-06-17 21:30  jgraham

	* trees_pre_ls.f90: General updates; nztot is disregarded an nz
	  from param.f90 is used as the local nz; tested phi calculations
	  and things look good

2009-06-17 21:00  jgraham

	* trees_base_ls.f90: Corrected bug in pt_of_grid function which is
	  used to return the global x,y,z values for the domain; there was
	  redundancy in the z calculation where the k-total index was
	  specified but an additional chunk offset was attempted by
	  multplying the z-chunk distance by coord. coord however is not
	  used execpt in parallel execution and therefore conflicted with
	  the use of k-total. A different attempt could be used which would
	  leave the coord offset but used the local k; this would allow for
	  parallel execution of trees_pre_ls but nproc would have to match
	  that of nproc lesgo

2009-06-17 16:30  jgraham

	* param.f90, trees_base_ls.f90, trees_pre_ls.f90: Issues still
	  remain with the MPI_split set to true stuff. the grid is not
	  being correctly generated. There is some discrepency between the
	  usage of nz in param.f90 and the trees_{} routines

2009-06-17 14:04  jgraham

	* param.f90, stats_init.f90: Set up case for running 1st run of

	  caused some problems; the routine ellipse_dist_point_2d_2 is
	  currently being used with no appearant issues as seen before; a

	  skewed cylinder about the z-axis. This, however, does not include
	  any rotations about the x or y axis. Also included all the mods
