	* io.f90, stat_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Updated/fixed TAVG and
	  SPECTRA calculations.  These should now work seamlessly between
	  runs.  The major change was this: the time increment is now
	  determined with {tavg,spectra}_dt which is a sum of dt's for the
	  steps between {tavg,spectra}_compute.  This replaces
	  {tavg,spectra}_time_stamp.

	  Note that there was an error in the spectra calculation for the
	  case when any single processor had multiple spectra calculations
	  to perform.

2012-08-01 19:44  rsteven

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): A number of changes has been made to
	  the file 1. In the previous version of the file a number of files
	  were opened for turbine_*_velcenter to make sure that the file
	  was available on each core. This is now changed such that the
	  file is only opened at the node were it needs to be available.
	  2. An error in writing the unfiltered node data to the file
	  lesgo.out is fixed.  3. A number of large 3D matrices is
	  suppressed in order to safe memory and I/O operations. These are
	  g_shift (only used to check some code), fg (now replaced by a
	  simple double to pass around the argument), and temp_array_2 that
	  was only used to write some data to file needed to check the
	  routine. The writing routines are still available as comments in
	  the code.  4. Cleaned up the variable definitions in the code.
	  There were quite some variable that were defined in the main
	  header of the file or in some of the subroutines, but were never
	  used. These unnecessary definitions are now removed.	5. Removed
	  a few old unnecessary comment blocks.

	* io.f90, stat_defs.f90 (stable_snap_20120602_branch): Reverted
	  previous commit

	  Previously a patch to optimize the tavg struct access was
	  applied. This however has the side effect that it breaks
	  compatibility with previously generated tavg.out files. Therefore
	  it will not be included in this stable release.

2012-07-17 22:29  jgraham

	* io.f90, stat_defs.f90 (devel_branch): This patch optimizes the
	  access pattern of the tavg_t structure

	  The purpose of this is to ensure sequential access for the tavg_t
	  structure when performing the averaging. In order to achieve this
	  the order in which the subtypes are defined in the tavg type must
	  be followed when accessing the structure. Since some variables
	  are only defined on the k=0 level it was necessary to add an MPI
	  only section for the summations at k=0 which the benefits of
	  using jzmin and jzmax are lost.

	  Also updated the functions in 'stat_defs' that are called from
	  'tavg_finalize'

	  NOTE: this patch will break the ability to reuse 'tavg.out' files
	  from previous simulations once it is applied, since the tavg_t
	  structure has been changed. Just be sure to discard any old
	  restart files after applying.

	* rns_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Updated output of RNS restart files to
	  be written in single record. This will save 16 bytes - whoa

	  Since it does place things in a single record the endianess is
	  much easily converted with 'convert-endian'

2012-07-01 11:19  rsteven

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Changed the opening of files in the
	  turbine routine. Apparently opening the same file on different
	  cores can cause the program to crash (is used because it is not
	  known which core will eventually need the file; only one core is
	  writing in the file during the simulation). On panoramix this
	  works fine all the time. On LISA (Dutch system) this works fine
	  most of the time, but sometimes it makes the program crash. Now
	  just open some dummy files in order to prevent this.

	* main.f90 (devel_branch): Added ability to turn off runtime
	  checking. So now if 'runtime' is less than zero it will be
	  ignored.

	  Also updated output message to use 'mesg' from the messages
	  module since it is the defacto interface for this.

	* input_util.f90, lesgo.conf, param.f90 (devel_branch): Moved
	  'runtime' variable from DOMAIN block to the TIME block. Since it
	  is time related it should go there. Updated comments regarding it
	  usage.

	* press_stag_array.f90 (devel_branch): Updated cached constant
	  names to reflect their definition which is more intuitive.

	  unpadd.

2012-06-29 23:49  jgraham

	* press_stag.f90 (devel_branch): Removed deprecated file
	  'press_stag' since this functionality is provided by
	  'press_stag_array'

2012-06-29 22:59  jgraham

	* main.f90 (devel_branch): Updated things to use the new clocks
	  module. The clock time is set automatically by the 'clock_stop'
	  call and is retrievable with the 'time' subtype of the
	  'clocks_type' structure.

2012-06-29 22:58  jgraham

	* clocks.f90 (devel_branch): Added a 'time' subtype to the
	  'clocks_type' structure. Also removed the 'clocks_time' function
	  as the 'time' is set implicitly whenever the clock is stopped.
	  This was done since it was found that the time is sometimes
	  needed more than once. Adding it to the 'clock_stop' reduces the
	  extra operations when needed multiple times and it cleans things
	  up a bit.

2012-06-29 22:35  jgraham

	* main.f90 (devel_branch): Changed the break in the time loop from
	  a 'goto' to an 'exit' statement. This uses functionality from F90
	  that allows the labeling of loops and provides a more descriptive
	  method for doing this.

	  Also created a clock_time_total variable since we resuse this
	  value which updates 'dummy' variables to have a more explicit
	  name. A real variable buffer for MPI, 'rbuffer', was created.

2012-06-29 22:09  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Fixed issue with MPI defs in param not
	  being declared.

2012-06-27 09:38  rsteven

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Corrected an error with the writing
	  of the files turbine*_velcenter when used on large grids. The
	  file ids must be known to all cores.

2012-06-27 00:49  rsteven

	* input_util.f90 (devel_branch): Added the reading of the new
	  parameter runtime from lesgo.conf

2012-06-27 00:48  rsteven

	* main.f90 (devel_branch): The main routine now takes care to stop
	  the simulation if the runtime that is used is close to the value
	  set in lesgo.conf. Note that cores communicate with eachother in
	  such a way that once the first cores has used a cpu that becomes
	  equal to the set time they all stop simulating. The output of
	  main.f90 now also gives the total number of iterations across the
	  simulations in stead of the number of simualtions in the
	  simulation itself.

2012-06-27 00:45  rsteven

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Adapted the subroutine output loop such
	  that it now looks at the total number of iterations across the
	  simulations in stead of only the number of iterations in a
	  particular simulation. The reason for this is that in the much
	  shorter run times the statistically stationary state is in most
	  cases not yet reached after the first run. Now all start
	  parameters can be set to typical values without the need to copy
	  different input files to lesgo.conf at unknown times (number of
	  runs).

2012-06-27 00:42  rsteven

	* lesgo.conf (devel_branch): Added the parameter runtime. This
	  variable sets the maximum runtime that is allowed by the program
	  in seconds. Note that the program only measures the time in the
	  time loop and not in the initialisation procedure of the program.
	  In addition, the program only checks once every wbase timesteps
	  whether the program is close to hitting the total simulation time
	  that is allowed. Therefore one has to incorporate a SAFETY
	  difference between the time asked in the job and the maximum time
	  allowed by the program. In general I would say that a safety of
	  30 minutes should be more than sufficient in case wbase=100 and
	  the grid is of a typical size we currently use.

2012-06-27 00:36  rsteven

	* param.f90 (devel_branch): Added the parameter runtime. This is
	  used to set the length of the simulations

2012-06-27 00:35  rsteven

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Added an addition output array to
	  the velocity array. In addition changed jt to jt_total at some
	  points to deal with shorter runtimes

2012-06-24 13:58  jgraham

	* sgs_stag_util.f90 (devel_branch): Combined computation of total

	  (fftw3_port_branch): This version of the code has been adjusted
	  so that it can use the FFTW3 library in stead of the FFTW2
	  library. For testing this version of the code can use both
	  version of the library by setting the flag FFTW3 in Makefile.in.
	  Putting the flag to 'yes' will execute the code using FFTW3 and
	  putting the flag to 'no' using FFTW2. This has been done to
	  verify that the output using the new library is the same as using
	  the old library. The code has been tested using gfortran and
	  intel compiler and the speed of the code is similar using FFTW2
	  and FFTW3. Now the planning stage of the FFTW routines uses the
	  FFTW_UNALIGNED flag as Fortran uses column-major ordering and
	  FFTW uses row-major ordering. We might want to use
	  'fftw_alloc_real' to do the fftw operations although this would
	  probably introduce adition copying of arrays as the normal
	  working arrays are not defined this way (some of the things
	  needed for this are put in as comments in the current code). In
	  addition, we can look whether we can use fftw3-mpi to perform the
	  2D ffts in paralel.

2012-06-01 14:19  jgraham

	* string_util.f90 (devel_branch): Added a string splicing mechanism
	  call 'string_splice'. The idea is to have a single call that will
	  generate a string without having to worry a/b all the formatting
	  stuff and internal writes. It does not eat leading or trailing
	  whitespace like 'string_concat' so is more universal in a sense.

2012-06-01 04:23  jgraham

	* README (devel_branch): Update the RNS section; still only have to
	  include the USAGE subsection. Other minor updates.

2012-05-31 23:59  jgraham

	* README (devel_branch): Quoted stuarts disclaimer

2012-05-31 23:53  jgraham

	* README (devel_branch): Updated sectioning for developer notes.
	  Trying to split usage information from development information

2012-05-31 23:48  jgraham

	* README (devel_branch): Finished first round of the "output"
	  section for the core data. Also added information for running
	  "cyl_skew_pre_ls"

2012-05-31 19:13  jgraham

	* compare.f90 (devel_branch): Removed irrelevant file. Never used
	  nor does it describe what it does.

2012-05-31 19:10  jgraham

	* debug_merge.f90 (devel_branch): Removed since never used and no
	  description is provided as to what it does.

2012-05-31 19:09  jgraham

	* mpif.h (devel_branch): Removed deprecated file. All MPI support
	  is provided through the MPI module

2012-05-31 19:08  jgraham

	* integrate.f90 (devel_branch): Renamed per to periodic for
	  clarity. Haven't used this module but may be useful if 1D signals
	  need to be integrated.

2012-05-31 17:19  jgraham

	* rns_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Reverted the change of writing RNS
	  restart data into single record to writing in multiple records.
	  This was done to preserve backwards compatibility with old data
	  files. The savings in disk space do not outweigh breaking this.

2012-05-31 14:27  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): MPI calls now use the local
	  communicator (comm) rather than MPI_COMM_WORLD so the processor
	  numbers range from 0 to nproc.  The $CPS flags are therefore not
	  needed.

2012-05-31 12:56  cverhul1

	* lesgo.conf, turbines_base.f90 (devel_branch): For CPS (concurrent
	  precursor simulations) turbines were being shifted forward in the
	  domain.  Since this amounts to a new orientation, this option was
	  added are orientation #5.  At the moment only a few general
	  orientations are being used.	If, in the future, we have many
	  specialized orientations we may want to read this information
	  (locations, sizes, etc) in from an input file.  For the cases
	  we've run up to now an input file seemed too cumbersome.

2012-05-31 11:15  cverhul1

	* turbines_base.f90 (devel_branch): Added spaces to match
	  lesgo.conf file (for readability)

2012-05-31 11:12  cverhul1

	* lesgo.conf (devel_branch): Added comments to turbines section

2012-05-31 11:07  cverhul1

	* initial.f90 (devel_branch): Variable "exst" needed within DYN_TN
	  flag.

2012-05-31 10:58  cverhul1

	* tridag_array.f90, tridag_array_pipelined.f90 (devel_branch):
	  Added back "fmt" variable - needed when DEBUG flag is used.

2012-05-30 22:59  jgraham

	* Makefile.in (devel_branch): Moved USE_SAFETYMODE up to sections
	  that are relavent switches

2012-05-30 21:47  jgraham

	* unpadd.f90 (devel_branch): Removed loops since just doing simple
	  stuff and there are no conditionals and is independent. Now using
	  explicit access for arrays which allow similar access patterns as
	  unrolled loops

2012-05-30 21:38  jgraham

	* padd.f90 (devel_branch): Removed loops since just doing simple
	  stuff and there are no conditionals and is independent. Now using
	  explicit access for arrays which allow similar access patterns as
	  unrolled loops

2012-05-30 21:11  jgraham

	* derivatives.f90 (devel_branch): Reverted to use .MULI. operator
	  since 1) it includes the safety of zeroed nyquist frequencies
	  through the zeroed elements of k and 2) provides a universal
	  interface for general operations which is analogous to standard
	  multiplication and aids in maintanability.

	  Any effort to avoid the zeroing operations from 1) are not
	  necessarily offset by the niceness of a one-liner esp. if the
	  residence time in this section is much less than other sections.
	  If really necessary the omission of the nyquist frequencies
	  should just be added to the interface.

2012-05-30 21:01  jgraham

	* emul_complex.f90 (devel_branch): Applied Richard's optimization
	  (from his inline version) for sequential data access for the
	  .MULI. operator function

2012-05-30 17:51  rsteven

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Corrected an error in the file that showed
	  during compiling

2012-05-30 17:30  rsteven

	* Makefile.in (devel_branch): Put in the extra flag SAFETYMODE. The
	  standard is yes and means that the BOGUS values are written to
	  several arrays for safety. When this flag is set to No these
	  operations are omitted for optimization. The gain of this
	  optimization is rather low, so it is recommended to keep this
	  flag to yes.

2012-05-30 17:27  rsteven

	* Makefile.fpp (devel_branch): Put in the addition preprocessor
	  flag. When SAFETYMODE=yes the BOGUS values are written. This is
	  the standard option. When no these operations are ommitted.

2012-05-30 17:26  rsteven

	* convec.f90 (devel_branch): Put in an option to prevent the
	  writing of the BOGUS value when this is requested.

2012-05-30 17:25  rsteven

	* derivatives.f90 (devel_branch): Inlined the MULI operator and put
	  in an option to prevent the writing of the BOGUS value when this
	  is requested.

2012-05-30 17:24  rsteven

	* clocks.f90 (devel_branch): Reverted back to the cpu-time version.
	  Kept in the other version in case we want to use them

2012-05-30 17:24  jgraham

	* README (devel_branch): Updated the output section. Still needs
	  info regarding the visualization data.

2012-05-30 17:23  rsteven

	* divstress_uv.f90, divstress_w.f90 (devel_branch): Put an option
	  in these file to prevent the writing of the value BOGUS when this
	  is requested.

2012-05-30 17:22  rsteven

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Corrected warnings from the compiler.

2012-05-30 17:22  rsteven

	* main.f90 (devel_branch): Put an option in here to prevent the
	  writing of the BOGUS values when the flag is not set.

2012-05-30 17:21  rsteven

	* padd.f90 (devel_branch): Simplified and optimized this routine.

2012-05-30 17:20  rsteven

	* press_stag_array.f90 (devel_branch): Put an option in here to
	  prevent the writing of the BOGUS value. In addition, inlined the
	  MULI operator here.

2012-05-30 17:10  rsteven

	* sgs_stag_util.f90 (devel_branch): Put the option in here to
	  prevent the writing of the BOGUS values.

2012-05-30 17:09  rsteven

	* unpadd.f90 (devel_branch): Simplified the writing in these
	  routines.

2012-05-29 16:17  cverhul1

	* README (devel_branch): Added turbines section

2012-05-27 21:45  jgraham

	* README (devel_branch): General updates

2012-05-27 21:44  jgraham

	* utils/cubes-process-data/lesgo/process-data.sh (devel_branch):
	  Updated process data script to correspond to general test case
	  setup

2012-05-24 12:28  rsteven

	* Makefile, divstress_uv.f90, main.f90 (devel_branch): Replaced
	  divstress_uv.f90 with the new routine. main.f90 and Makefile are
	  changed such that they call divstress_uv.f90 in stead of
	  divstress_uv2.f90

2012-05-24 10:37  jgraham

	* README (devel_branch): Updated required version of tecryte

2012-05-23 22:42  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Reverted changes with
	  write_tecplot_header_xyline and intel compiler. This had to do
	  with the explict interface and subroutine having the same name
	  within the tecryte library.

2012-05-23 20:22  rsteven

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Corrected warnings of compiler. Note that
	  I commented out the call at line 1875, which is for some reason
	  not accepted by the intel compiler. Gfortran has no problems with
	  this.

2012-05-23 20:21  rsteven

	* Makefile (devel_branch): Added the new subroutine divstress uv2

2012-05-23 20:20  rsteven

	* interpolag_Sdep.f90 (devel_branch): Correction of warnings of
	  compiler

2012-05-23 20:15  rsteven

	* initial.f90 (devel_branch): Correction of warnings from compiler

2012-05-23 20:14  rsteven

	* lagrange_Ssim.f90, lagrange_Sdep.f90, interpolag_Ssim.f90,
	  ic.f90, functions.f90 (devel_branch): Correction of warnings of
	  compiler

2012-05-23 20:13  rsteven

	* main.f90 (devel_branch): Changed divstress routines which saves
	  one fft

2012-05-23 20:10  rsteven

	* sgs_stag_util.f90, scaledep_dynamic.f90, press_stag_array.f90,
	  mpi_transpose_mod.f90 (devel_branch): Correction of warnings of
	  compiler

2012-05-23 20:08  rsteven

	* tridag_array.f90 (devel_branch): Correction of warnings of
	  compiler.

2012-05-23 20:07  rsteven

	* tridag_array_pipelined.f90 (devel_branch): Correction of warnings
	  of compilers

2012-05-23 18:32  rsteven

	* lesgo.conf (devel_branch): Added the variable tbase, which
	  determines how often data are outputted by the turbine routine.

2012-05-23 18:30  rsteven

	* input_util.f90 (devel_branch): Correction of the previous upload

2012-05-23 18:23  rsteven

	* input_util.f90 (devel_branch): Adds an additional input variable
	  for the turbine model that is used to determine how often the
	  output is written.

2012-05-23 18:18  rsteven

	* clocks.f90 (devel_branch): Changes the calculation of the
	  timestep from CPU time to wall clock time

2012-05-23 18:17  rsteven

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Makes sure that the turbine model
	  runs correctly in a CPS simulation by adressing the correct
	  processes in the MPI commands. In addition, some addition output
	  (the velocity at the turbine center) is now written to files and
	  the output is now only written to file every xx time steps.

2012-05-23 18:13  rsteven

	* turbines_base.f90 (devel_branch): Adds a variable to output the
	  turbine data only every xx steps and shifts the turbine positions
	  when a CPS simulation is run

2012-05-23 14:35  jgraham

	* Makefile.in (devel_branch): Updated ifort compiler options;
	  removed '-ipo' from as it has been prone to seg faults

2012-05-21 14:21  jgraham

	* input_util.f90, io.f90, lesgo.conf, param.f90, stat_defs.f90
	  (devel_branch): Added checkpointing for spectra calculations;
	  still needs testing

2012-05-21 13:08  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Fixed issue with trying to checkpoint tavg
	  data when 'tavg_calc=.false.'

2012-05-21 12:55  jgraham

	* io.f90, stat_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Renamed tavg time step
	  variable

2012-05-21 12:53  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Fixed time step size for averaging time
	  averaging data for the very first computation. Richards
	  implementation originally did this correct as an approximation is
	  made for the very first computation. The first computation on
	  subsequent simulation will use 'tavg_time_stamp' read from
	  'total_time.dat'

2012-05-21 10:57  jgraham

	* Makefile.in (devel_branch): Updated gfortran compiler flags

2012-05-21 09:10  jgraham

	* param.f90 (devel_branch): Removed old commented parameter
	  declarations

2012-05-21 01:19  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Added subroutine for checkpointing time
	  averaged data 'tavg_checkpoint'. This now handles intermediate
	  checkpointing and should be called by 'tavg_finalize' at the end
	  of the simulation for the final checkpoint.

2012-05-21 01:10  jgraham

	* param.f90 (devel_branch): Added global definitions for restart
	  file names

2012-05-21 00:49  jgraham

	* io.f90, stat_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Updated the variable names
	  for the time stepping of the time averaging stuff. The time for
	  the previous time averaging summation is called 'tavg_time_stamp'
	  and is now included in the file 'total_time.dat' for use between
	  simulations. This resolves the issue of the previous time stamp
	  unknown when a simulation is restarted.

2012-05-21 00:46  jgraham

	* param.f90 (devel_branch): Removed tavg time stepping stuff since
	  they are defined in stat_defs

2012-05-21 00:46  jgraham

	* initial.f90 (devel_branch): Removed usage of 'path' from
	  'sim_param' usage statement

2012-05-21 00:44  jgraham

	* scaledep_dynamic.f90 (devel_branch): Changed usage of 'path' to
	  param

2012-05-21 00:44  jgraham

	* sim_param.f90 (devel_branch): Removed usage of 'path' from param
	  since it is not directly used within the module

2012-05-20 23:41  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Added dynamic time const for SGS stuff to
	  'checkpoint'. Removed time step argument to 'output_{loop,final}'
	  as these use the global 'jt' value. Also made sure intermedidate
	  checkpointing does not occur at the final time step since this is
	  done by 'output_final'.

2012-05-20 23:38  jgraham

	* main.f90 (devel_branch): Removed time step specification in calls
	  to output_{loop,final}. These are to respect the global value
	  'jt' in param.

2012-05-20 23:06  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Added time information and simulation
	  state output within checkpoint (ie contents of 'total_time.dat').

2012-05-20 22:35  jgraham

	* input_util.f90, io.f90, lesgo.conf, param.f90, param_output.f90
	  (devel_branch): Added iteration skip for time averaging; based on
	  Richard's original mod. Now time averaging can be sampled every
	  'tavg_nskip' time steps

2012-05-20 22:28  jgraham

	* param_output.f90 (devel_branch): Added checkpointing variables

2012-05-20 22:27  jgraham

	* initial.f90, input_util.f90, io.f90, lesgo.conf, main.f90,
	  param.f90 (devel_branch): Added checkpointing of the restart
	  data. Currently this only includes the vel.out files and
	  checkpointing for other modules should be added to io.checkpoint.
	  The input file now have the flags 'checkpoint_{data,nskip}' which
	  control things.

2012-05-19 15:04  jgraham

	* Makefile.in (devel_branch): Turned off binary output by default.
	  Updated compiler to gfortran by default.

2012-05-19 15:03  jgraham

	* Makefile.in (devel_branch): Removed system library paths from
	  LIBPATH

2012-05-19 14:15  jgraham

	* lesgo.conf (devel_branch): Removed unused 'ntree' variable from
	  CYL_SKEW block

2012-05-19 14:13  jgraham

	* rns_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Converted all RNS element output files
	  to be written using file id's. The file id's are determined from
	  the tecryte library.

2012-05-19 14:12  jgraham

	* rns_base_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Removed parameter specification
	  of RNS output file id's. These are now determined by the tecryte
	  library.

2012-05-19 13:25  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Fixed issued with file names
	  in 'write_output_lesgo'. Before all data was written to phi.out.

2012-05-19 12:30  jgraham

	* Makefile (devel_branch): Added 'finalize.f90' to source list.

2012-05-19 12:30  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Added 'closefiles' subroutine which is
	  used to close all files opened by 'openfiles'. Updated file id
	  for ke output to be managed by tecryte library.

2012-05-19 12:29  jgraham

	* main.f90 (devel_branch): Placed all finalize calls in the new
	  subroutine 'finalize'; also added a 'Simulation complete' message
	  at the end for the final statement.

2012-05-19 12:28  jgraham

	* finalize.f90 (devel_branch): Add driver subroutine for calling
	  finalize sections. This is analogous to the 'initialize'
	  subroutine.

2012-05-19 12:26  jgraham

	* README (devel_branch): Updated documation to reflect new usage of
	  file identifiers. We will allow the tecryte library to manage the
	  file identifers when used. These begin at 1001. If any file
	  identifiers are to be used that are not managed by the tecryte
	  library they should be <=1000

2012-05-19 02:32  jgraham

	* utils/interp/Makefile (devel_branch): Reverted EXE name to
	  default 'interp'

2012-05-19 02:20  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Updated 'check_ke.dat' to have file id 999
	  as specified in readme.

2012-05-19 02:16  jgraham

	* rns_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Updated all rns output to write data
	  based on file id. Now the files are opened after the header is
	  written with 'write_tecplot_header_xyline'

2012-05-19 02:15  jgraham

	* rns_base_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Updated output file id's from
	  7xxx to 8xxx as specified in the README

2012-05-19 02:14  jgraham

	* rns_base_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Added file id's for rns output

2012-05-19 02:12  jgraham

	* README (devel_branch): Updated reserved file id list; should now
	  include most of what we use.

2012-05-19 01:11  jgraham

	* README (devel_branch): Added comment regarding the minimum
	  version of 'tecryte'; as of now >= 2.0 is required.

2012-05-19 01:09  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Changed all point output using the 'point'
	  datatype to write to file using file id's. It was also required
	  to open the point files in 'stat_defs'. This is also done for
	  'energy' which writes 'check_ke.dat' and is now in the 'io'
	  module.

2012-05-19 01:07  jgraham

	* main.f90 (devel_branch): Updated io module usage to include the
	  subroutine energy

2012-05-19 01:06  jgraham

	* energy.f90 (devel_branch): Moved subroutine 'energy' to io.f90

	  This was done to consolidate the io functions. Also since we are
	  file id's to write time signal data, 'openfiles' is used to open
	  the check_ke.dat file, which is already in io.f90

2012-05-19 01:05  jgraham

	* Makefile (devel_branch): Removed energy.f90 from SRC list since
	  it is now in io.f90

2012-05-19 01:04  jgraham

	* stat_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Removed file name ('fname')
	  attribute from the 'point' datatype. We will force the usage of
	  file id's to help optimize things by writing to open files.

2012-05-19 01:02  jgraham

	* README (devel_branch): Added comments regarding assigned file
	  id's

	  It will be necessary to keep track of these assignments

2012-05-18 23:41  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Separated binary output from ascii output.
	  Now all binary is grouped such that if BINARY=yes in Makefile.in
	  there will be no ascii output when outputing domain data. This
	  removes extra variable names required and cleans up the sections.

	  Also group other types of output such as level set, extra output,
	  etc.

2012-05-18 14:59  jgraham

	* Makefile.fpp (devel_branch): Fixed conflict with previous merge.
	  The conflict was not resolved initially.

2012-05-18 12:59  jgraham

	* Makefile.fpp (devel_branch): Merged from
	  stable_snap_20110707_branch (tag
	  stable_snap_20110707_branch_merge_5)

2012-05-18 12:57  jgraham

	* Makefile.fpp (devel_branch): Merged from
	  stable_snap_20110610_branch (tag
	  stable_snap_20110610_branch_merge_22)

2012-05-18 12:56  tag stable_snap_20110610_branch_merge_22

2012-05-18 12:56  tag stable_snap_20110707_branch_merge_5

2012-05-16 18:45  rsteven

	* input_util.f90, lesgo.conf, turbines.f90, turbines_base.f90
	  (devel_branch): Added a new input flag in the turbine module in
	  order to continue a simulation with the disk averaged velocity of
	  a previous simulation

2012-05-16 18:28  jgraham

	* Makefile.in (devel_branch): Readded '-heap-arrays' for intel
	  compiler. This is required for running simulations with large
	  domains.

2012-05-16 15:17  rsteven

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Update in ouput, write
	  total_time_dim in stead of calculating it since the calculation
	  is not true anymore now that the timestep is variable

2012-05-16 14:56  cverhul1

	* initialize.f90 (devel_branch): included initialization of dt_dim
	  (and included necessary use statements this time)

2012-05-16 14:51  cverhul1

	* initialize.f90 (devel_branch): added initialization of dt_dim

2012-05-16 14:49  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): moved epsilon update (for cfl_dt)
	  outside loop

2012-05-16 14:41  rsteven

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Updated the value eps such that it
	  now takes care of the variable time step size

2012-05-16 13:02  cverhul1

	* turbines_base.f90 (devel_branch): [no log message]

2012-05-14 23:28  jgraham

	* string_util.f90 (devel_branch): Updated 'string_concat' with
	  additional subroutines

2012-05-14 23:28  jgraham

	* sgs_hist.f90 (devel_branch): Updated internal writes to use
	  'string_concat' instead; cleans up code

	  which populates the tree data structure.

2012-05-11 23:58  jgraham

	* lesgo.conf (devel_branch): Update default of lbc_mom to be bottom
	  wall. The stress free condition is used in only special cases.

2012-05-11 19:58  rsteven

	* utils/interp/: Makefile, README, interp.f90 (devel_branch):
	  Adjusted the interpolation routine such that it now can also

2012-05-11 18:45  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): bugfix in earlier submitted version of
	  sgs_stag_util.f90 Some optimization in press_stag_array.f90.
	  Output of the entire code is cheched by comparing the kinetic
	  energy after 500 timesteps and this gave identical results. Code
	  seems to be about 25 to 30 % faster now.  In the file io.f90
	  extended the number of files that can be outputted in binary and
	  these are actived by setting the flag BINARY. Otherwise the
	  tecplot formatted output will be generated.

	* functions.f90 (devel_branch): Incorporated the function
	  linear_interp directly in trilinear_interp as this saves
	  computational resources. For the same reason put the if statemens
	  in the function cell_indx in between debug quotes to suppress
	  that these are always executed, since this functions is called a
	  lot. Maybe it would be even better to inline this function as
	  well.

2012-05-11 15:09  jgraham

	* string_util.f90 (devel_branch): Updated argument definitions for
	  string_concat subroutines

2012-05-11 14:56  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Updated remaining file name to be
	  generated using string_concat; if strings were concatenated using
	  '//' then they were left as is.

2012-05-11 14:31  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Converted generation of filenames to use
	  'string_concat'; this cleans up things and provides a homogenous
	  way for generating names and strings.

2012-05-11 14:29  jgraham

	* string_util.f90 (devel_branch): Added addition subroutines to the
	  string_concat polymorphic function. Also updated all real
	  conversions to be 6 decimal places; this is controlled by
	  'rformat'.

2012-05-11 13:56  rsteven

	* string_util.f90 (devel_branch): Fixed issue with internal
	  concatenate write; neede to trim string when concatenating

2012-05-11 09:14  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Cleaned up creation of file name creation
	  for point data using the update string_concat subroutine. Now
	  everything is placed on a single line.

2012-05-11 09:12  jgraham

	* string_util.f90 (devel_branch): Updated the polymorphic funciton
	  string_concat to include additional subroutines; extended
	  generality.

2012-05-10 15:30  jgraham

	* rns_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Added summation of forces for r, b,
	  and beta elements. Updated calls to write_tecplot_* when writting
	  data.

	  Also cleaned up creation of variable lists using the update
	  string_concat subroutine. Now everything is placed on a single
	  line.

2012-05-10 15:27  jgraham

	* string_util.f90 (devel_branch): Added additional subfunction for
	  overloaded function string_concat

	  Can now to one-liners for concatenating strings instead of
	  multiple calls as before.

2012-05-10 14:37  jgraham

	* Makefile (devel_branch): Updated source lists so that the RNS
	  module is compiled independently of the CYL_SKEW module. It is
	  required to provide the rns_init_ls subroutine by a rns_<foo>_ls
	  moudle and is now only provided by the rns_cyl_skew_ls module. In
	  the future, other geometry and setups are to provide rns_init_ls
	  subroutine.

2012-05-09 18:36  rsteven

	* Makefile.in, param.f90, stat_defs.f90
	  (stable_snap_20120501_branch): Changes necessary for io.f90 to

2012-05-09 18:25  rsteven

	* io.f90 (stable_snap_20120501_branch): Adjusted the call to the
	  averaging function such that it now only calculates the averages
	  based on the flow data every xx time steps, where xx is
	  determined by wbase. This is done in order to save computational
	  time. In addition I added a function BINARY to output some of the
	  data in binary in case I want this. This output is not in tecplot
	  format, but all original functionality is maintained.

2012-05-09 18:20  rsteven

	* sgs_stag_util.f90 (stable_snap_20120501_branch): Optimizations to

2012-05-09 17:58  rsteven

	* Makefile.fpp, Makefile.in (stable_snap_20120501_branch):
	  Configured the Makefile for intel compiler and added an option

2012-05-09 12:43  jgraham

	* input_util.f90, lesgo.conf, string_util.f90 (devel_branch):
	  Removed specification of location number (*_nloc) for points,
	  {x,y,z}planes, spectra, etc. The number of locations is based
	  solely on the location string. This removes complexity when
	  mismatches occur between *_nloc and *_loc especially when *_calc
	  is true for that datatype.

2012-05-09 12:41  jgraham

	* initialize.f90 (devel_branch): Readded call to param_output

	  not needed to use multiple records. NOTE: previous "rns_force_ls"
	  restart files can not be used.

	  Several reasons for the change: 1) 'stress free' was one of the
	  options and now with the usage of the input file all the
	  whitespace on the line is eaten. Therefore, it was required to
	  change the specification to a contiguous string or change it all
	  together. 2) ubc was already specified as an integer so it seemed
	  to make sense to go this route. 3) Using and integer is should be
	  faster to evaluate logicals than strings (?)

	  MPI_FINALIZE to ensure all processes are finished first.

	  When running concurrent precursor simulations (USE_CPS=yes) it
	  seems that the "blue" set of processes where exiting before "red"
	  set where able to finish writing their time averaged files (the
	  "blue" set where not writing time averaged data).

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Instantaneous output (domain, xplane, etc)
	  now outputs every 'nskip' timesteps after 'nstart'.  Previously
	  output occured at every time after 'nstart' for which the global
	  time was evenly divisible by 'nskip'.

	  Example:  for nstart=100, nskip=500	Previously would output at
	  100, 500, 1000, 1500...    Now outputs at 100, 600, 1100, 1600...

	* mpi_defs.f90 (stable_snap_20120110_branch): Changed reorder flag
	  for the mpi_cart_create to be false.

	  Before this was true, but in MPICH2 implementations it was
	  ignored. However, on bluefire's implementation the order was
	  reversed causing issues with misalignment of the processors when
	  using concurrent precursor stuff. Changing to false fixes all

	  each timestep (due to cross-terms like uw); for the rest of the
	  averaged quantities, the interpolation is only done during
	  tavg_finalize.  To interpolate to the w-grid an lbz-level was
	  added to tavg_t.  The new interp_to_w_grid function can be found
	  in functions.f90.  For the bottom-most physical level (coord==0
	  and k==1 on the w-grid which corresponds to the wall) the
	  following quantities are manually set to zero: u, v, w, txx, txy,
	  tyy, tzz, fx, fy.  This is done because the lower value used

	  parameter lbz to replace $lbz (don't need to write the
	  $if($MPI)... every time).  For subroutines with lbz defined
	  locally, it has been replaced with lbz2.  (2) Created two
	  variables called jzmin and jzmax which are defined in param.f90
	  and set in grid.f90 and correspond to the z-levels that the
	  processor owns.  This should avoid if(coord==0)-type statements
	  but no changes/updates have yet been made to the existing code.
	  For the future it might make sense to either (A) define all
	  variables with overlap levels and only calculate for the
	  owned-levels, syncing before taking vertical derivatives or
	  interpolating between grids OR (B) only defining variables for
	  the owned-levels and writing more sophisticated routines for

	  simulation times, both iteration and total. A clock type was
	  created along with functions/subroutines which act on them.

	  Also the information that is printed to screen to help things
	  look more informative/intuitive

	* emul_complex.f90 (devel_branch): This fixes unbounded memory
	  allocation growth.

	  Originally, the emul_complex module used a pointer declaration
	  with the arrays returning values in the multiplication functions.
	  This caused new space to be allocated everytime the function was
	  entered since the pointer is not implicitly deallocated. The
	  attribute was changed to allocatable which fixes the issue.

	* Makefile, Makefile.in, derivatives.f90, emul_complex.f90,
	  fft.f90, press_stag_array.f90, test_filtermodule.f90
	  (devel_branch): Created module for emulating complex operations
	  with real interleaved arrays

	  This module pulls all of the original emulation stuff from fft
	  and condenses things into three multiplication (overloaded)
	  operators. All of the sections using the emulation stuff have
	  been updated. A basic test was also performed and showed that the
	  results with the new module/operators provides the exact same
	  results as was produced with the original implementation.

	  Old TSUM related stuff was removed from Makefile

	  This null pointer is of type integer(2); originally it was not
	  typed but XLF compiler complain a/b this

	  fft_revisit_branch (from pre_fft_revisity to
	  fft_revisit_branch_merge_1)

	  These additions provide several updates which 1) remove the
	  passing of real arrays to complex arrays 2) provide interfaces
	  for performing emulation of complex operations and 3) remove the
	  dependence on the deprecated "equivalence" command in the
	  pressure solver (press_stag_array.f90)

	  These additions have been tested against the previous
	  implementation (starting from pre_fft_revisit_branch_merge) and
	  it has been found that the exact same results are obtained with
	  the new and previous versions.

	  The emulation of complex operations also provides approx. 1.5
	  speedup for those sections

	  Previously only arrays with a starting z index of 0 could be
	  sync'd with the mpi_sync_real_array subroutine. The subroutine
	  has been extended to also include support for those with 1 as the
	  starting z index. The synchronization for these variables is
	  limited to SYNC_DOWN operations, however, since its the only

	* interpolag_Sdep.f90, interpolag_Ssim.f90 (devel_branch): Changed
	  interpolation from velocities (u,v,w) to distances (x,y,z) to
	  allow for variable dt.  The grid interpolation is done during the
	  running sum (in sgs_stag) between cs updates.  Also, it was
	  previously assumed that the F* variables were located on the
	  uvp-grid at the bottom-most level (next to the wall).  This is
	  not the case and the code has been fixed to account for that
	  mistake.  There is still a cheat at the top-most level to avoid a
	  conflict with trilinear_interp, but the resulting error should be
	  small.

2011-06-03 15:43  cverhul1

	* sgs_stag_util.f90 (devel_branch): Changed interpolation from

	  These interpolation distances are all stored on the w-grid.
	  Also, the running average (over cs_count timesteps) does not
	  begin until just before DYN_init (which represents startup time
	  for the dynamic SGS models).

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Fixed segmentation fault/insufficient
	  virtual memory bug with the ifort compiler and -heap-arrays flag;
	  the issue was due to arrays used for assembling z-plane averaged
	  data having the pointer attribute and only being allocated on
	  coord=0 for MPI jobs

	  Two fixes are possible: 1) have all processes allocate the
	  pointer for the assembly arrays or 2) remove the pointer
	  attribute and only use allocatable arrays; option 2) was used
	  since only coord=0 uses the allocated data and we don't use the
	  pointer extention and only the allocatable attribute is needed

	  Also added MPI error checking to the create of MPI types

	* interpolag_Ssim.f90 (devel_branch): Lagrangian interpolation is

	  also added Lag avg for the new "Taylor microscale" update of the
	  timescale.  Note: the interpolation at the uppermost level is
	  done with a "cheat".

2011-04-12 16:05  cverhul1

	* lagrange_Ssim.f90 (devel_branch): Added "Taylor microscale"

	  General clean up

2011-04-03 22:31  jgraham

2011-03-11 22:52  jgraham

	* Makefile.in (devel_branch): Added USE_WEIGHT_INTFC for

	  their own subroutines to reduce redundency

	  Nested weighted interface sections within FPP statements

2011-03-11 20:12  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Fixed erroneous interpolation of dwdz to

	  Removed multiplication of forces by cell volume during output;
	  for consistency all output should be per cell volume

2011-03-11 01:20  jgraham

	* level_set.f90 (devel_branch): Added weighting back into force
	  calcs; it seems that the sharp interface is the culprit of the
	  forcing issues.

	  The current weighting implementation is elementary, so things
	  will need more rigorous attention

2011-03-10 13:36  jgraham

	* functions.f90, io.f90, level_set.f90, stat_defs.f90, turbines.f90
	  (devel_branch): Moved interp_to_uv_grid to functions module; also
	  changed it to be a function instead of a subroutine so that it
	  can be used in-place (esp. when outputing data) so that
	  additional temporary arrays do not have to be created; this
	  requires interpolating as needed where no globally defined
	  interpolated arrays are used.

	  inst_write now outputs pressure field and RHS for diagnostics;
	  created separted "contained" subroutines for resetting bogus data
	  and performing MPI sync's for the output data; updated consistent
	  usage of f{x,y,z}_tot and all forces are now in correct
	  non-dimensional units

	  Separted w-grid variables in tavg_t from uv-grid variables;
	  careful zeroing of bogus values and MPI syncing is also performed
	  during output; created tavg w-to-uv interpolation function

	  Updated tavg_zero_bogus to have 2D component

	  Updated turbines to use interp_to_uv_grid in new state

2011-02-11 21:51  jgraham

	* functions.f90 (devel_branch): Corrected statement enforcement of
	  1<= cell_indx <= Nx-1 to 1<= cell_indx <= Nx since this is what

	  been autowrapped using autowrap_i to insure that Nx+1 maps to 1

2011-02-11 21:15  jgraham

	* functions.f90 (devel_branch): Updated autowrapping in cell_indx;
	  enforced the returned values from cell_indx to always be the

2011-02-08 20:22  cverhul1

	* functions.f90 (devel_branch): Interpolation and cell-index
	  functions now work for any point in the processor (k=0:nz instead
	  of k=1:nz-1 as done previously).  Just check to make sure the
	  z-value to be interpolated is between z(0) and z(nz) (lives in
	  the proc) before calling either of these functions.

2011-02-08 17:59  cverhul1

	* main.f90 (devel_branch): Applied forcing arrays fxa, fya, and fza
	  are now set to zero at the beginning of the timestep.  This
	  prevents accumulation is f*a is set using a form f*a = f*a + new
	  term.

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Changed read and write of
	  conditional averaging velocity files:

	  READ: forgot about Tecplot header

	  WRITE: write velocity fields (Tecplot,3D) needed separate calls
	  for u,v,w -- otherwise Segfault (overload?).	When the combined
	  call with u,v,w all at once was used for _hi and _lo there was a
	  problem, even if one was within an if(.false.) loop.	In that
	  case it hit a Segfault at the very beginning of the
	  turbines_finalize subroutine (doesn't make sense).  Anyway,
	  separate calls did the trick...

2010-08-17 14:24  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Turbine forcing files are not
	  overwritten if turbine_cumulative_time==.true.

2010-08-17 13:43  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): The code now reads turbine disk-avg
	  velocity mean and rms files to set limits for conditional
	  averaging (can set individually or as an average across all
	  turbines).  Initialization has been moved so it won't be confused
	  with values that should be set for each run.	(Compiles cleanly

	  run - next step: read in mean/rms

2010-08-16 17:26  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Turbines conditional averaging is
	  now done in a separate subroutine.  Values from previous runs can

	  default is to CA for all turbines.  Will want to implement
	  rms/mean read from file in the future.

2010-07-21 16:39  jgraham

	* rns_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Updated rns_elem_force; b_elem force

	  processor independent to avoid mpi hang

2010-07-18 15:50  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Moved 3D data write up in the file.

	  Added work around for writing large 3D data: only write 3

	  this can be done with mulitple calls to write_real_data_3D.

2010-07-18 15:48  jgraham

	* stat_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Changed tavg* rs* stuff to have

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Added option for staggered
	  orientation.	This required the use of mod to represent the
	  spectral BCs.

2010-06-18 12:51  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Updated default time avg window (now
	  10 min)

2010-06-18 12:46  cverhul1

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Problem with tavg zplane has been fixed --
	  number of subtypes was incorrect

2010-06-18 10:07  cverhul1

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): The variable cs_opt2 was being set to zero
	  at top of domain (in output only).  This is unnecessary and has
	  been removed.

2010-06-16 10:54  jgraham

	* io.f90, stat_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Removed
	  rs_zplane_{tot,buf}_t and tavg_zplane_{tot,buf}_t definitions
	  from stat_defs and moved to tavg_finalize in io, since these are
	  the only place they are used

2010-06-16 10:33  jgraham

	* rns_cyl_skew_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Added subroutine for setting
	  the mapping arrays of cluster ids to RNS elements

2010-06-15 17:00  cverhul1

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Added cs_opt2 to tavg_t and tavg_zplane_t.
	  I think the values are bogus at nz (like fx,txx,etc) but I'm not
	  sure -- set within tavg_finalize.  This still needs verification.

2010-06-15 16:56  cverhul1

	* stat_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Added cs_opt2 to tavg

2010-06-15 16:49  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Variables sx and sy are only for
	  spacing between turbines.

2010-06-15 14:50  cverhul1

	* stat_defs.f90, stat_defs.f90 (devel_branch): GU

2010-06-15 14:35  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Small change to turbine_u_d_T.dat
	  file read.

2010-06-15 14:27  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): (1) Nested MPI send/rec within FPP
	  if statements (2) Added turbine forcing output for entire row and
	  entire col (3) Added power density to turbine output (4) Code now
	  reads/writes disk-averaged velocity history to/from file
	  turbine_u_d_T.dat (if cumulative_time==.true) (5) Turbine forcing
	  output is no longer overwritten (if cumulative_time==.true)

2010-06-15 14:22  cverhul1

	* stat_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Removed u_d_T_flag from turbines
	  type

2010-06-15 11:35  jgraham

	* rns_cyl_skew_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Now includes most of the tree
	  cluster to RNS element mapping needed to complete the data
	  structure

2010-06-14 16:04  jgraham

	* rns_cyl_skew_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Added addtional subroutines
	  for filling the RNS data structure

2010-06-14 12:23  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_ls.f90, rns_base_ls.f90, rns_cyl_skew_ls.f90
	  (devel_branch): Added addition corrections for the rns data
	  constructs

2010-06-11 19:20  jgraham

	* Makefile.in (devel_branch): Updated defaults

2010-06-11 18:12  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90 (devel_branch): GU

2010-06-11 14:42  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90, initial.f90, io.f90, level_set.f90,
	  main.f90, mpi_defs.f90, rns_ls.f90, turbines.f90 (devel_branch):
	  Added synchronization flag to mpi_sync_real_array; also added
	  mpi_sync parameters in mpi_defs; these are MPI_SYNC_DOWN,
	  MPI_SYNC_UP, MPI_SYNC_DOWNUP and the names are hopefully
	  self-evident; it is planned to also added user defined
	  synchronization to the definition flags whereby any sync type can
	  be performed.

	  All dependent subroutines were updated accordingly; compiles
	  cleanly

2010-06-11 13:32  jgraham

	* mpi_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Added mpi error catching in
	  mpi_sync_real_array; also reverted sync'ing to use mpi_sendrecv

2010-06-11 13:22  jgraham

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Added FPP nesting for
	  mpi_sync_real_array call

2010-06-11 13:16  jgraham

	* rns_cyl_skew_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Created small-unique
	  subroutines for filling and setting arrays and variables which
	  will be used for filling the rns module data structure

2010-06-11 13:15  jgraham

	* rns_base_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Moved all geometry related
	  parameters and arrays to rns_cyl_skew_ls; these will be used
	  exclusively in rns_cyl_skew_ls

2010-06-11 12:17  jgraham

	* rns_base_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Changed ref_plane to ref_region

2010-06-11 12:16  jgraham

	  and secondary RNS structures

2010-06-10 15:40  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Problem with bogus w-velocities
	  solved.  Interp_to_uv_grid was being called before syncing array.

2010-06-10 15:14  jgraham

	* main.f90 (devel_branch): Added full syncronization of u,v,w using
	  mpi_sync_real_array for testing

2010-06-10 15:04  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Change instantaneous point write to use
	  w_uv

2010-06-10 14:35  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Forced interpolation to exlucde k=0 and
	  k=nz+1; these should be filled when syncing with
	  mpi_sync_real_array

2010-06-10 09:48  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): For now: when calculating the
	  disk-averaged velocity, w is not mapped to the uv grid (this
	  should probably be fixed soon)

2010-06-09 15:41  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Fixed problem with sending disk
	  forces to all procs.	Added comments to try to diagnose
	  w-velocity problem (bogus values).

2010-06-09 15:09  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): GU

2010-06-09 14:33  jgraham

	* mpi_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Reverted mpi_sync_real_array to use
	  explicit mpi_send/recv calls; need to check previous
	  implementation

2010-06-09 11:57  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Changed interpolation variable in
	  inst_write to be allocatable; specified plane locations when
	  writing planar data as a vector; still needs testing

2010-06-09 11:28  cverhul1

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Small fix.

2010-06-09 11:22  cverhul1

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Changed plane inst write to 3D format	:)

2010-06-09 10:58  cverhul1

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Changed output format of x/y/z-plane inst
	  write (to match block format).  Currently written in 2D format --
	  3D would be better but it conflicts with write_real_data_3D
	  format.

2010-06-08 16:26  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Added MPI send and receive calls -
	  everything should be working now

2010-06-08 14:54  cverhul1

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Moved cumulative_time flag to param, under
	  "timestep parameters" and fixed tecplot header for vel_zplane_avg
	  file.

2010-06-08 14:53  cverhul1

	* param.f90 (devel_branch): Moved cumulative_time flag to param,
	  under "timestep parameters"

2010-06-08 11:55  jgraham

	* Makefile.in, grid.f90, rns_base_ls.f90, turbines.f90
	  (standalone_rns_module_branch): Merged from devel_branch

2010-06-08 11:49  jgraham

	* grid.f90 (devel_branch): Added arrays used for autowrapping i and
	  j; this is needed when ever points lie in the 0 or nx (ny) cell
	  and interpolation is performed.

2010-06-07 16:15  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Added framework for MPI in
	  turbines_forcing -- should only need to add the MPI send/receive
	  commands (as indicated by ###)

2010-06-07 14:14  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Added code to output node locations
	  for each proc separately (to check that the domain was split
	  correctly) -- nodes_filtered_c

2010-06-07 13:35  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Implementing MPI: each proc now
	  identifies nodes in its domain.  Also, convolution was shifting
	  disks down - that has been fixed.

2010-06-04 20:54  jgraham

	* rns_ls.f90, Makefile, cyl_skew_ls.f90, cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90,
	  initial.f90, mpi_defs.f90, rns_base_ls.f90, stat_defs.f90
	  (standalone_rns_module_branch): Merged from devel_branch

2010-06-04 20:42  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Commented previous CD calcs; now
	  only have subroutine to fill tree array

2010-06-04 20:40  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Set to use standard grid
	  dimensions

	* rns_cyl_skew_ls.f90, rns_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Created rns
	  definitions module for the cylinder skew tree used to define the
	  structures of the rns module; moved all pertinent stuff from
	  rns_ls.f90 to rns_cyl_skew_ls.f90

2010-06-03 13:17  jgraham

	* stat_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Removed unused sections

	  set of points

2010-06-03 11:19  cverhul1

	  initialization

2010-06-02 22:34  jgraham

	* level_set.f90 (devel_branch): Set interprocessor syncing to use

	* main.f90 (devel_branch): Updated comments

2010-06-02 22:21  jgraham

	  to use mpi_sync_real_array

2010-06-02 22:20  jgraham

	* mpi_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Change mpi_sync_real_array to use
	  mpi_sendrecv

2010-06-02 14:18  jgraham

	* io.f90, param.f90, stat_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Moved all output
	  settings and parameters to param; stat_defs now only includes
	  time averaged statistics; io contains the complementary arrays
	  for the output stuff in the module definitions

	  Test for both serial and parallel cases

2010-06-02 14:15  jgraham

	* main.f90 (devel_branch): Removed uneeded output flag

	  'formatted'/'unformatted' flag for write_real_data; updated calls
	  appropriately

2010-06-01 16:03  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Converted all write_real_data_* routines
	  to write in BLOCK format instead of POINT to allow for
	  significant speed increases when loading into Tecplot; also
	  updated write_tecplot_header_ND to use DATAPACKING=BLOCK instead
	  of POINT.

	  Need to adjust tavg_t%t<> (sgs stress) at overlap nodes -
	  something is set to bogus and needs to be sync'd.

2010-06-01 14:17  jgraham

	* grid.f90 (devel_branch): made x and y to be allocated to nx+1 and
	  ny+1 for adding padded region

2010-06-01 14:16  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Corrected stupid mistake with coordinates
	  usage when adding buffer region - test to work correctly

	  tecplot loading

2010-06-01 12:00  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Added to all write_real_data_* routines a
	  flag to add buffer region along specified directions; e.g. this
	  will make values at  x(imax+1) equal to those at x(i)

2010-06-01 11:51  jgraham

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Converted all write_real_data_*
	  calls to have buffer flag; it is set to add buffer region on x
	  and y by default; also updated tecplot header write calls to
	  include the extra data on i and j

2010-06-01 11:49  jgraham

	* functions.f90 (devel_branch): Renamed index_start to cell_indx;
	  also added function for computing index if a buffer region at
	  i=imax+1 is desired - it simply returns 1 if this is the case and
	  i otherwise

2010-05-27 13:24  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Corrected compile issues with serial cases
	  - output still needs testing

2010-05-27 11:05  hmorales

	* convec.f90 (devel_branch): Hector commit test 2

2010-05-27 11:00  hmorales

2010-04-29 18:10  jgraham

	* rns_base_ls.f90, rns_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Corrected force

	  region

2010-04-29 16:17  jgraham

	* ic.f90 (devel_branch): Nested zo_... in TURBINES FPP statement

2010-04-28 17:49  cverhul1

	* main.f90 (devel_branch): Turbine initialization must occur before
	  initial( ) is called.

2010-04-28 16:49  jgraham

	  definition of dt_dim.

2010-04-28 12:07  jgraham

2010-04-28 11:58  jgraham

	* rns_base_ls.f90, rns_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Added ability to
	  define beta sub regions; the old way needs to be made

	* Makefile.in, io.f90, main.f90, param.f90, rns_base_ls.f90,
	  rns_ls.f90, stat_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Added total_time and
	  total_time_dim to keep track of the accumulated time when dt is
	  changed. Also added preliminary way of performing time
	  integration over multiple cases; this takes into account a change
	  in dt.

	  Still need to add any secondary calculations to tstats_finalize

	  its turned off

2010-04-19 10:15  cverhul1

	  to add flexibility to the code and aid in making newer additions
	  simplier

2010-03-29 21:38  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Corrected tsum write call to
	  write_real_data_3D; it uses individual calls for each variable as
	  it seems that when writing a large number of variables (< 4 ?)

2010-03-29 17:12  cverhul1

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Small fix for non-LVLSET case

2010-03-29 16:57  jgraham

	* main.f90 (devel_branch): Updated clock time format

2010-03-29 16:36  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Corrected formatting issue with
	  write_real_data* stuff; also made usage more explict to ensure
	  that the size of the arrays being passed match the size of imax,
	  jmax, etc. Still need to make sure all other places where used
	  are compliant

2010-03-26 15:20  cverhul1

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Fixed Tecplot 2D and 3D write subroutines

2010-03-25 23:00  tag pre_tree_struc_convert

2010-03-25 23:00  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Started correction with
	  overlapping ellipses during integration; still needs work and
	  does not compile

2010-03-21 16:54  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90, grid.f90 (devel_branch): Changed grid_build
	  to allocate x to nx+2; set cylinder_skew_pre_ls to use grid_build

2010-03-21 12:26  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90 (devel_branch): General clean up; also
	  changed messages to use the message module; not all routines use
	  this though

2010-03-20 20:15  jgraham

	* mpi_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Corrected wrong array specification
	  for var in mpi_send/recv commands; also corrected mpi_datasize
	  type

2010-03-20 15:13  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90, io.f90, mpi_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Moved
	  mpi_sync_real_array to mpi_defs; updated dependent routines to
	  use it correctly

2010-03-20 15:03  jgraham

	* Makefile (devel_branch): Added mpi_defs to SRCS when using mpi

2010-03-20 15:02  jgraham

	  ngen_reslv

2010-03-20 14:46  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_base_ls.f90, cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90, io.f90 (devel_branch):
	  Converted routines to use mpi parameters defined in param;

2010-03-20 14:45  jgraham

	* main.f90, mpi_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Moved mpi initialization
	  from main into mpi_defs module; the mpi_defs module is used
	  across different programs

2010-03-20 14:43  jgraham

	* Makefile (devel_branch): Added main settings Makefile.in; added
	  specific Makefile for cylinder_skew_pre_ls in order to handle
	  dependencies using makedepf90; this separation was required in
	  order to avoid issue with dependency overlap with the default
	  lesgo make command

2010-03-20 14:20  jgraham

	* Makefile.cyl_skew_pre_ls, Makefile.in (devel_branch): Added main
	  settings Makefile.in; added specific Makefile for
	  cylinder_skew_pre_ls in order to handle dependencies using
	  makedepf90; this separation was required in order to avoid issue
	  with dependency overlap with the default lesgo make command

2010-03-19 17:55  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Fixed errors (mostly variable
	  declaration, etc) so now it compiles

2010-03-19 09:00  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Fixed top boundary issue in
	  interp_to_uv_grid

2010-03-19 08:48  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Added comments regarding the subroutine
	  interp_to_uv_grid; the subroutine must be called by all procs
	  otherwise things will hang; may want to call it immediately after
	  a time step is completed.

2010-03-19 08:39  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Removed redundant calculations for overlap
	  nodes; these are computed at coord "up" and are simply sent
	  "down"

2010-03-18 19:29  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Added my own FFT and implemented
	  filtering in x-y planes.  These changes need to be tested in a
	  simpler program.

2010-03-18 16:31  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Added time-averaging for disk
	  velocity + Many small changes throughout

	  statement)

2010-03-18 11:11  cverhul1

	* stat_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Added more turbine variables

2010-03-18 11:11  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): finished turbine_nodes subroutine...
	  still needs to be tested

2010-03-17 21:08  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_base_ls.f90, param.f90 (devel_branch): Updated defaults

2010-03-17 16:00  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_base_ls.f90, cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90, param.f90
	  (devel_branch): General clean up of chi calculation routines;
	  double check filtering operation analytically and with matlab -
	  looks good;

	  set default param settings to kunlun's tree

2010-03-17 13:09  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Code now works correctly; was
	  using global valued vector when computing filtered values; still
	  needs clean up and verification

2010-03-17 12:04  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_base_ls.f90, cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90 (devel_branch): GU

2010-03-17 11:21  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Corrected global generation
	  trunk counter

2010-03-17 10:49  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Added numerical integration
	  for filtered chi; compiles, but still needs testing

2010-03-17 09:33  jgraham

	  projection when computing center of ellipse location for filtered
	  chi calcs

2010-03-17 00:12  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_base_ls.f90, cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Tested
	  chi calcs; still having issues with filter calcs

2010-03-17 00:11  jgraham

	* Makefile (devel_branch): Reset default flags to have debugging
	  flags

2010-03-16 22:28  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Reverted output to original;
	  still needs work and clean up

2010-03-16 22:24  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_base_ls.f90, cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Fixed
	  outstanding issues; still need to correct write to file stuff
	  with standard data output and variable type mismatch

2010-03-16 22:16  jgraham

	* Makefile, cyl_skew_base_ls.f90, cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90
	  (devel_branch): General clean up and fixes; still needs work

2010-03-16 21:34  jgraham

	* Makefile, cyl_skew_base_ls.f90, cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90, grid.f90,
	  io.f90 (devel_branch): Added preliminary calculations of filtered
	  indicator function (chi) - still needs testing. Also converted
	  several write to file statements to use the tecplot_header
	  routines and write_real_data routines - not all are compliant at
	  this point.

	  The chi calculations are in a rough state; the program
	  cylinder_skew_pre_ls is also still in a rough state and needs to
	  have a "tree" data structure for handling global data; will want
	  to perform calculations in a global sense also.

2010-03-15 11:37  cverhul1

	* test_filtermodule.f90 (devel_branch): Reverted back to revision
	  1.1.1.1

2010-03-15 11:36  cverhul1

	* main.f90 (devel_branch): Moved error back to test_filtermodule

2010-03-12 17:23  hmorales

	  test_filtermodule.f90: if (ifilter==1 and (model==6 or model==7))
	  then ERROR

2010-03-12 12:36  cverhul1

	* test_filtermodule.f90 (devel_branch): Removed error message (now
	  in main) and included filter type as a calling argument to make
	  this subroutine more general

2010-03-10 16:54  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Working on the subroutines

2010-03-10 16:54  cverhul1

	  statement

2010-03-10 12:06  cverhul1

	  removed nskip

2010-03-10 08:38  jgraham

	* Makefile, functions.f90 (devel_branch): GU

2010-03-09 22:33  jgraham

	  to MPI_INTEGER

2010-03-09 13:43  cverhul1

	* stat_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Expanded zplane_avg_t to allow for
	  more outputs.  It's getting a little messy.

2010-03-09 13:12  cverhul1

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Expanded zplane_avg and moved calculations
	  from output_loop to new subroutine: zplane_avg_compute

	  Still working on formatting/processing the output

2010-03-08 20:01  jgraham

	* functions.f90 (devel_branch): Changed data type to real of
	  nsum_global; this was to avoid issue on hhpc

2010-03-08 19:37  jgraham

	* rns_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Set default write action to true

2010-03-08 19:36  jgraham

	* stat_defs.f90 (devel_branch): GU

2010-03-08 17:47  cverhul1

	* stat_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Added zplane_avg_t (used in io.f90)

2010-03-08 17:46  cverhul1

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Added output function: u,v,w averaged over
	  zplane and time.  Output format still needs work.  (Still need to
	  erase files before a new simulation, for example) Will add other
	  time-avg stats later.

2010-03-08 15:59  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Nested mpi stuff in MPI FPP
	  statement

2010-03-08 15:54  jgraham

	* param.f90 (devel_branch): Removed whitespace

2010-03-08 11:02  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Fixed deallocate misspelling

2010-03-08 09:45  cverhul1

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Fixed non-mpi function calls/usage

2010-03-07 20:07  jgraham

	* trees.conf (devel_branch): Cleaned up stuff

	  flags

2010-03-07 01:10  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): corrected comment

2010-03-07 01:03  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): GU

2010-03-07 00:46  jgraham

	* io.f90, rns_ls.f90 (devel_branch): renamed write_real_data_array
	  to write_real_data as the name was misleading

2010-03-06 23:54  jgraham

	* io.f90, rns_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Created write_real_data
	  subroutines for writing 1, 2, and 3D data to file. As implemented
	  the subroutines allow for write attributes such as 'rewind' or
	  'append' and 'formatted' and 'unformatted' and also handle an
	  arbitrary number of variables to write. The routines also allow
	  for the spatial coordinates to be specified as optional.

	  Still needs work and may need to be split up into specialized
	  files for writing as append data or unformatted files just to
	  eliminate the checks needed to sort these things.

2010-03-06 12:02  jgraham

	* rns_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Corrected filename assignment

2010-03-06 11:52  jgraham

	  write_tecplot_header_xyline

2010-03-06 00:28  jgraham

	* io.f90, rns_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Corrected usage with io sub
	  calls; fixed write to unopend file

2010-03-06 00:06  jgraham

	* Makefile, rns_ls.f90, strmod.f90 (devel_branch): Added strmod
	  module which concatenates strings, with strings, integers, and
	  reals; updated Makefile accordingly.

	  Updated the planar velocity write in rns_ls to write u,v,w; it
	  also now uses the write_tecplot_header_xyline and
	  write_real_data_append files; also uses the strmod interface
	  strcat for creating strings

2010-03-06 00:04  jgraham

	* main.f90 (devel_branch): Temporarily added rns write stuff to
	  avoid io-rns_ls circular module usage

2010-03-06 00:03  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Changed planar data output to have dat
	  extension; removed rns_write stuff due to circular module usage

2010-03-05 21:50  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Created routines for writing Tecplot
	  header info and some other related small routines; still need to
	  clean up unused stuff.

	  Will want to create the routines for writing the data

2010-03-05 21:48  jgraham

	* rns_ls.f90 (devel_branch): General clean up

2010-03-05 16:23  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Created subrouting for writing an arbitry
	  number of variables to file (write_real_data_append); the default
	  action is to append data

	  Also created subroutine for creating Tecplot header data for
	  xyline formatted files

2010-03-05 16:22  jgraham

	* stat_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Added fname attribute to point
	  type; this was done for writing data to file; may want to exclude
	  it and used an "extend" type when needed

2010-03-05 16:20  jgraham

	* functions.f90, rns_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Removed diagnostic wts
	  comments

2010-03-05 14:08  jgraham

	* stat_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Removed unused variable spec

2010-03-05 14:01  jgraham

	* stat_defs.f90 (devel_branch): Added needed nskip for tstats data
	  type

2010-03-04 21:14  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90, functions.f90, io.f90, rns_base_ls.f90,
	  rns_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Addded initial calculation of u
	  velocity on the RNS planes; it works but its ugly; still needs
	  work, clean up, and verification

2010-03-04 16:11  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_base_ls.f90, main.f90, rns_base_ls.f90, rns_ls.f90
	  (devel_branch): Added data types for rns and rns_planes for
	  handling data; hacked on rns_init but still needs work. also need
	  to configure cylinder_skew_pre_ls to generate the rns_planes_ls
	  files

2010-03-04 15:36  jgraham

	* Makefile, main.f90, rns_base_ls.f90, rns_ls.f90 (devel_branch):
	  Added initial RNS files (modules); these serve as the bases for
	  the function/subroutine additions. Makefile and main have been
	  updated to utilized the new additions, including the correct
	  Makefilie and FPP flags. Implicit dependence on the level_set
	  module is enforced by nesting the functions within LVLSET FPP
	  statements

2010-03-04 15:32  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Changed rns_planes output
	  file name to include _ls as an indicator of the dependency on the
	  level_set module

2010-03-03 23:55  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Added preliminary RNS CD

	  rns_planes.out files which contains the 3-bounding points for the
	  averaging planes used for the local velocity calculations

	* forcing.f90 (devel_branch): Added "call turbines_forcing()"
	  (within FPP flag)

2010-03-03 12:55  cverhul1

	* Makefile (devel_branch): Added FPP flag for TURBINES

2010-03-03 12:53  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): Basic module structure

2010-03-03 12:16  cverhul1

	* turbines.f90 (devel_branch): This will become the turbines module

2010-03-02 20:31  tag pre_turbines_tag

2010-03-02 20:31  jgraham

	* functions.f90 (devel_branch): Removed redundant loops; also
	  removed usage of nzeta*neta size matrix - this was stupid.
	  General cleanup/comments

2010-03-02 12:54  cverhul1

	* stats.f90, stats_init.f90 (devel_branch): no message

2010-03-02 12:50  cverhul1

2010-03-02 12:47  cverhul1

	* main.f90 (devel_branch): Added stats_init() subroutine to "use
	  io, only: "

2010-03-02 12:46  cverhul1

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Added (moved) the following subroutines
	  from stats_init.f90 and stats.f90:	stats_init ()
	  tsum_compute()    tavg_compute()    rs_compute()
	  plane_avg_compute(jt)

2010-03-01 17:21  cverhul1

	* param.f90 (devel_branch): Organized parameters based on function:
	  MPI, Domain, Model, Time, BC/IC, Output

	  Maintained order for u_star, z_i, dt... (variables that are not
	  defined independently)

	  This was done to facilitate (future) integration of parameters
	  currently found in subroutine stats_init()

2010-03-01 09:29  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Removed unneeded coord_of_rank usage

2010-03-01 09:26  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Corrected location of VERBOS FPP statement

2010-02-28 20:28  jgraham

	* io.f90, main.f90, param.f90, stats_init.f90, utils/interp.f90
	  (devel_branch): Removed diagnostic plane_avg_3D stuff; nested wts
	  to only main proc

2010-02-28 20:27  jgraham

	* functions.f90 (devel_branch): Commented diagnostic wts; moved
	  cell_center calcs within association check; general comments

2010-02-28 20:25  jgraham

2010-02-28 18:59  jgraham

	* functions.f90 (devel_branch): Added autowrapping for x,y
	  dirctions for plane_avg_3D was added; also added correct k index
	  computation

2010-02-28 16:23  jgraham

	* functions.f90, io.f90, stats.f90 (devel_branch): Put
	  interp_to_uv_grid subroutin in io module as its mostly used here;
	  this subroutine should be called whenever a w-grid variable is
	  wanted on the uv-grid; it contains a check of whether the
	  interpolation has occured for the current time step; functions
	  and routines that use w to uv-grid interpolated values have been
	  changed accordingly;

	  still needs testing

2010-02-28 16:20  jgraham

	* energy.f90 (devel_branch): Returned to basic w interpolation

2010-02-28 00:09  jgraham

	  plane_avg_3D

2010-02-28 00:07  jgraham

	* io.f90 (devel_branch): Set to use the interp_to_uv_grid_buf
	  routine for the domain inst writes; still needs more work

2010-02-28 00:06  jgraham

	* functions.f90 (devel_branch): Added interp_to_uv_grid_buf for
	  correct interpolation; it uses mpi send/recieves; a better
	  implementation combining interp_to_uv_grid needs to be done

2010-02-27 22:47  jgraham

	* functions.f90 (devel_branch): Updated interp_to_w_grid function;
	  tested and works well

2010-02-27 21:39  jgraham

	* functions.f90 (devel_branch): Needed to use z on w-grid for
	  index_start

2010-02-27 21:25  jgraham

	* functions.f90 (devel_branch): Corrected k index in index_start;
	  needed to be set so a local k index is computed

2010-02-27 20:48  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_ls.f90 (devel_branch): GU

2010-02-27 20:48  jgraham

	* grid.f90 (devel_branch): Added k=0 z computation for MPI

2010-02-27 20:47  jgraham

	* stats_init.f90 (devel_branch): moved find_istart to index_start;

	* functions.f90 (devel_branch): moved find_istart to index_start;
	  index_start uses a direct computation of the index; routines that
	  used find_istart have been converted to use index_start

	  Added interp_to_w_grid function; still need to resolve the usage
	  of the uv, w grids and the interpolation

2010-02-27 16:31  jgraham

	* functions.f90 (devel_branch): The plane_avg_3D function is now in
	  working condition; preliminary testing has been done and compares
	  well with cylinder_CD and cylinder_skew_CD Uinf calcs; still need
	  to make sure correct averaging is used. Also may want to use
	  plane_avg_3D for other Uinf calcs

	* functions.f90, stats_init.f90 (devel_branch): Moved find_istart
	  routine to functions; functions as now includes both standard
	  fortran functions and subroutines that serve as functions; these
	  are to be functions and subroutines that perform general
	  operations

	* Makefile (devel_branch): Added DEVEL Makefile flag; this should
	  be used when developing sections of experimental or leaving

2009-07-08 21:20  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90 (cylinder_skew_branch): Fix issue with bottom
	  k=0 not being initialized correctly

2009-07-08 13:32  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90 (cylinder_skew_branch): Added an initial
	  rotation angle about the z axis (zrot_angle); removed
	  initialization of k=0 values of phi to -BOGUS - they are now
	  BOGUS; more work is still needed here to sync values of
	  internodal boundaries; may want to implement some mpi between

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90 (cylinder_skew_branch): The correction for
	  multiple generations and trunks has been made; code clean up

2009-07-07 11:18  jgraham

	  with multiple generations and multiple trunks.

2009-07-06 14:08  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90, param.f90, stats_init.f90
	  (cylinder_skew_branch): Reverted cylinder_skew results to have a
	  bottom; it has been found that when the line interpolations are
	  performed nodes are found outside of the domain in level_set when
	  the cylinder is skewed. A test case has shown that a 'suspended'

	* trees_base_ls.f90 (devel_branch): Corrected bug in pt_of_grid
	  function which is used to return the global x,y,z values for the
	  domain; there was redundancy in the z calculation where the
	  k-total index was specified but an additional chunk offset was
	  attempted by multplying the z-chunk distance by coord. coord
	  however is not used execpt in parallel execution and therefore
	  conflicted with the use of k-total. A different attempt could be
	  used which would leave the coord offset but used the local k;
	  this would allow for parallel execution of trees_pre_ls but nproc
	  would have to match that of nproc lesgo

	* cyl_skew2.f90: Added another cylinder test routine.

2009-05-22 13:07  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90: The minimum distance routine works as
	  expected now; may want to spend time documenting an cleaning up.

2009-05-22 11:21  jgraham

	* min_dist_to_ellipse.f90, test.f90: Implementation for the
	  min-dist to ellipse routine has been completed; it appears to
	  work correctly now, with limited testing with test.f90

2009-05-22 10:36  tag poly_root_method

2009-05-22 10:36  jgraham

	* min_dist_to_ellipse.f90, test.f90: General updates

2009-05-21 23:38  jgraham

	* test.f90: General updates

2009-05-21 23:28  jgraham

	* min_dist_to_ellipse.f90, test.f90: General updates; trying to
	  test the min-dist stuff; still needs work.

2009-05-21 22:43  jgraham

	* min_dist_to_ellipse.f90, test.f90: General updates; double
	  checked min-dist calc routine

2009-05-21 21:17  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90, test.f90: General updates

2009-05-21 15:55  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90: Almost there; code is 75% now. still need to
	  work	out the minimum distance routine

2009-05-21 13:29  jgraham

	* min_dist_to_ellipse.f90: General updates; still need to confirm
	  the routine.

2009-05-21 13:28  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90: Work is still needed on in the cylinder_skew
	  routine; more information is needed about the location of the gcs
	  point wrt to the cylinder; almost there.

2009-05-21 10:47  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90, test.f90: General updates; rewrote how the
	  vectors are handled; move to more intuitive name declaration.

	  Still having issues with the output though; believe it is an
	  issue with the minmum distance calculations.

2009-05-20 22:53  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90, min_dist_to_ellipse.f90, test.f90: General
	  updates; still need to resolve the skewed cylinder calculations;
	  may want to switch back to the non-orthogonal coordiate system

2009-05-18 14:23  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90, compile_cyl_skew.sh: General updates

2009-05-18 13:02  jgraham

	* compile_cyl_skew.sh, cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90: Included minimum
	  distance to ellipse calculation. Also incorporated the correct
	  (not yet tested) values for a and b regardless of the rotation of
	  the skewed cylinder about the z-axis. This, however, does not
	  include any rotations about the x or y axis. Also included all
	  the mods and libraries required for the compilation of the code.
	  May not want to do this for differing platforms as this might
	  cause problems later on. Another note, the shared library
	  libgeometry.so should probably be changed to a static library for
	  convinience.

2009-05-17 21:39  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90: General update; corrections for a and b in
	  the ellipse equation need to be generalized.

2009-05-17 21:31  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90: Added distance calculation from above and
	  below cylinder.

2009-05-14 17:03  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90: General updates

2009-05-14 16:51  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90: General updates

2009-05-14 16:45  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90: Partially completed the formulation of the
	  new rotated local reference frame used for generating the signed
	  distance function

2009-05-14 13:48  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90: Change the method by which the minimum
	  distance is computed. This works much better is and is more
	  numerically stable; work is still required to iron out the
	  details and to merge with the existing tree code.

2009-05-14 11:45  jgraham

	* trees.conf, trees_setup_ls.f90: General updates; still working on
	  getting the skewed cylinder stuff in the code; have been working
	  on a prototype code that will be added later.

2009-05-14 11:44  tag pre_redo

2009-05-14 11:44  jgraham

	* cyl_skew_pre_ls.f90: Adding prototype cylinder_skew code; it is
	  intended that this code will be deleted later.

2009-05-12 21:46  jgraham

	* trees_base_ls.f90, trees_setup_ls.f90: General updates; still
	  working on understanding how the level set values phi are applied
	  in the existing framework.

2009-05-11 17:26  jgraham

	* Makefile, param.f90, trees.conf, trees_base_ls.f90,
	  trees_setup_ls.f90: General updates; in the process of
	  understanding how to generate the level set phi file

	* defs.f90, lesgo.inp, param.f90: Move pertinent variables
	  declarations to defs.f90 to create the capability to read an
	  input file (lesgo.inp); The input file read statement hasn't been
	  added yet and the module usage in the subroutines has not been
	  updated.

2009-01-10 12:51  jgraham

	* ic.f90, main.f90, param.f90: Set DEBUG=true; general write to
	  screen stuff was added;

	* NOTES, io.f90, main.f90, param.f90, sim_param.f90,
	  trees_base_ls.f90: Updated NOTES; code is still not produce
	  physical results; the initialization has been check and seems ok,
	  but the solver is still not producing realistic results.

2009-01-06 20:51  jgraham

	* NOTES: Added notes file which contains code annotation.

2009-01-06 20:50  jgraham

	  libraries are installed by default to /opt/fftw2/lib and the
	  ifort compiler is used by default. Currently, the code will
	  compile but executation has not been successful.
