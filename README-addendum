Notes:

This branch allows one to account for the changes in temperature and salinity on the buoyancy force.

This scalar transport branch has significantly diverged from the master and devel branches. This branch should be considered essentially a different code.

This branch requires the tecryte library for input/output. Installation of tecryte is straightforward and instructions are found in the ./tecryte directory included here.

The Lagrangian scale dependent SGS model for the scalar terms has not been validated.

The file gsw_data_v3_0.dat must be included in the run directory as input.

The scalar transport features of this branch were authored by Eshwan Ramudu. Details can be found in the paper by Ramudu et al.:
