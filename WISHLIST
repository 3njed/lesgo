lesgo wish list: let the fun begin

** Check for consist usage of variables existing on w-grid. 
   There are several variables that are written to file that
   exisit on the w-grid - we need to make sure that they are
   correctly interpolated to the uv-grid before they are written.
   This applies not only for variables written to file but any
   instance that a w-grid variable is operated against a uv-grid
   variable.

** Add checkpointing.
