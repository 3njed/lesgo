lesgo wish list: let the fun begin

(**) denotes items that have not been implemented
(-->) denotes items that are in progress

** Check for consist usage of variables existing on w-grid. 
   There are several variables that are written to file that
   exisit on the w-grid - we need to make sure that they are
   correctly interpolated to the uv-grid before they are written.
   This applies not only for variables written to file but any
   instance that a w-grid variable is operated against a uv-grid
   variable.

** Add checkpointing.

--> Create documentation. Good place to start is the README. Would 
   be nice to have a formal pdf covering the basic background info,
   usage of lesgo, and any idiosyncrasies that are important to
   know

** Convert code to use an input file. This would be very nice! The
   code would need to fully implement dynamic allocation of arrays. 
   Also need to consider the input format - 1) this could be a custom
   format where all info is read in a strings and using delimiters
   required values could be extract or 2) can use Fortran namelists
   to express the input data using standard Fortran data types
   (probably the best way to go)
